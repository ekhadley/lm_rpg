            "content": "## Harry Potter RPG Master File\n\nThis document contains the complete ruleset, spellbook, and narration instructions for a Harry Potter-themed RPG set at Hogwarts. It is designed to provide an immersive, narrative-driven experience while maintaining clear mechanics for gameplay.\n\n## Ruleset\n\nThe ruleset of the game largely follows the DnD 5'th edition ruleset, with some major modifications.\n\n### Character Creation\n- **Stats**: Each character has four primary ability scores ranging from 1 to 20. The stats have an initial **minimum of 8** and a **maximum of 13**. The total points **must not** sum to more than 40.\n  - **Magical Prowess (MP)**: Innate magical talent and spellcasting ability.\n  - **Physical Prowess (PP)**: Strength, agility, and physical resilience.\n  - **Mental Acuity (MA)**: Intelligence, perception, and magical intuition for knowledge and investigation.\n  - **Social Grace (SG)**: Social and conversation ability.\n- **Skill Modifiers**: For checks using any primary stat, add `floor((stat - 10) / 2)` to calculate the bonus to the roll.\n- **Proficiencies**: Specific skills tied to each stat. Choose **two** for a first year character.\n  - **MP**: Charms, Transfiguration, Standard spells, Curses, Jinxes, Elemental spells, Healing spells, Enchantment, Nonverbal Casting.\n  - **PP**: Flying, Dueling, Stealth, Melee, Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand.\n  - **MA**: History of Magic, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Herbology, Investigation, Perception, Potions.\n  - **SG**: Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Performance.\n- **Proficiency Modifier (PM)**: If making a check with a proficient skill, add your proficiency modifier. Starts at 1, grows with year.\n- **House**: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Each provides unique abilities.\n- **Magical Stamina (MS)**: Starts at `10 + (Year * 2) + MP Modifier`. Depletes with spellcasting. recharges via rest or potions.\n- **Hit Points (HP)**: Starts at `10 + (Year * 2) + PP Modifier`. Represents physical health.\n- **Starting Spells**: Choose 3 Basic spells.\n- **Backstory**: Describe the character's upbringing, home life, motivations, goals, fears, habits, etc.\n\n### House Abilities\nEach house provides two special abilities, one at Year 1 and another at Year 4.\n\n#### Gryffindor Abilities\n- **Year 1: Heroic Surge**: Once per long rest, gain temporary MS equal to `Year + Proficiency Bonus`. This bonus MS disappears after 10 minutes or 5 turns. If you end up with less than 0 MS, you faint for an hour.\n- **Year 4: Swish and Flick**: Once per combat, you may cast two offensive spells in a single action.\n\n#### Hufflepuff Abilities\n- **Year 1: True Friend**: When you use the Help action to aid an ally's check, they gain a +2 bonus to their roll in addition to Advantage.\n- **Year 4: Perseverance**: When at 0 MS, you can still attempt to cast a spell by taking 1d4 Hit Point damage, adding 1d4 for each spell difficulty category.\n\n#### Ravenclaw Abilities\n- **Year 1: Quick Study**: Reduce the required downtime or number of checks needed to learn a new spell or proficiency through Personal Study by one step (GM discretion).\n- **Year 4: Eureka Moment**: Once per long rest, you can choose to succeed on one MA-based skill check (Investigation, History of Magic, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Perception) as if you had rolled a natural 20.\n\n#### Slytherin Abilities\n- **Year 1: Cunning**: Once per long rest, you can reroll any failed SG-based check.\n- **Year 4: Resourceful Magic**: Once per long rest, you may attempt to cast any one spell you have seen successfully cast within the last 24 hours, even if it is not in your spellbook. You must still meet the MS cost and make the spellcasting check.\n\n### Dice Mechanics\n- **Checks**: Roll `d20 + Stat Modifier + PM (if proficient)` vs. a Difficulty Class (DC) to determine success.\n- **Proficiency Bonus**: Increases with year:\n  - Year 1: +1\n  - Year 2\u20133: +2\n  - Year 4\u20136: +3\n  - Year 7: +4\n- **Spellcasting**: To cast a spell, roll `d20 + MP Modifier + PM (if proficient in the spell\u2019s category)` vs. the spell\u2019s DC. MS cost is spent **regardless** of success or failure.\n- **Saving Throws**: When targeted by a spell or effect requiring resistance, roll `d20 + Stat Modifier (specified by the spell/effect)` vs. the caster's Spell Save DC (`8 + Caster's MP Modifier + Caster's Prof Bonus`) or a set DC for environmental effects.\n\n### Hit Points and Physical Health\n- **Taking Damage**: HP is reduced by attacks, hazards, or certain strenuous activities.\n- **Critical State**: At 0 HP, a character falls unconscious and is incapacitated. Further damage while unconscious may lead to death (GM discretion or specific rules for lasting injuries).\n  - **Instant Death**: Certain effects, such as the *Avada Kedavra* curse, cause instant, permanent death on a failed save, bypassing the unconscious state.\n  - **Stabilization**: Spells like *Episkey* restore HP as described in the spellbook. Reviving a character at 0 HP requires a healing spell, potion, or physical assistance.\n- **Recovery**:\n  - **Short Rest** (1 hour): Regain HP equal to `2d6 + PP Modifier`.\n  - **Long Rest** (8 hours): Regain all lost HP.\n\n### Spell Mechanics\n- **Spell Difficulty & Cost**: Spells are categorized with corresponding DCs and MS costs:\n  - **Basic**: DC 10, **1 MS** (e.g., *Lumos*, *Incendio*)\n  - **Intermediate**: DC 15, **3 MS** (e.g., *Expelliarmus*, *Reducto*)\n  - **Advanced**: DC 20, **5 MS** (e.g., *Expecto Patronum*, *Confringo*)\n  - **Expert**: DC 25, **7 MS** (e.g., *Avada Kedavra*, *Fiendfyre*)\n- **Categories**: Spells align with proficiencies under MP (e.g., Charms, Elemental, Healing).\n- **Special Requirements**: Some spells need conditions (e.g., *Expecto Patronum* requires focus on a happy memory, potentially requiring a separate check like MA DC 10 under stress).\n- **Magical Stamina Management**:\n  - MS depletes with each spell cast.\n  - At 0 MS, no spells requiring MS can be cast (unless an ability like Hufflepuff's Perseverance allows it).\n  - **Recharge**:\n    - **Short Rest** (1 hour): Regain MS equal to `Year + MP Modifier + Proficiency Bonus`.\n    - **Long Rest** (8 hours): Regain full MS pool.\n    - **Potions**: Specific potions (e.g., Pepperup Potion) might restore MS (e.g., DC 15 Potions check to brew, restores 1d6+1 MS upon consumption).\n\n### Damage Types, Resistances, and Vulnerabilities\n- **Damage Types**: *Fire*, *Force*, *Cold*, *Radiant*, *Psychic*, *Slashing*, *Piercing*, *Bludgeoning* (for physical).\n- **Resistance**: Creature takes **half damage** from that type.\n- **Vulnerability**: Creature takes **double damage** from that type.\n- **Immunity**: Creature takes **no damage** from that type.\n- **Sample Traits**: Inferi (Vulnerable: Fire, Immune: Cold, Piercing); Ghosts (Immune: Physical, Force); Trolls (Resistant: Slashing, Bludgeoning). The GM determines these for NPCs/creatures.\n\n### Nonverbal Spellcasting\nNonverbal spellcasting involves performing magic without speaking the incantation aloud, requiring significant concentration and magical control.\n\n- **Requirements**:\n  - Any spell can be attempted nonverbally at any year.\n- **Mechanics**:\n  - When attempting to cast a known spell nonverbally, the **Spellcasting DC increases by 7**.\n  - If the character is proficient in Nonverbal Spellcasting, the **Spellcasting DC increases by 4** instead.\n  - The MS cost for the spell remains the same as its verbal counterpart.\n  - The caster makes the standard spellcasting check: `d20 + MP Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if applicable)` vs. the **new, higher DC**.\n- **Benefits**:\n  - **Stealth**: Allows casting spells without revealing intent through spoken words, useful for ambushes or subtle magic.\n  - **Circumvention**: Enables casting when silenced or otherwise unable to speak, provided the spell doesn't also require gestures that are restricted.\n\n### Combat and Dueling\n- **Initiative**: All participants roll initiative `d20 + PP Modifier` at the start of combat.\n- **Actions**: On your turn, you can take **one Action** (e.g., Cast a Spell, Attack, Use an Object, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help) and **move** up to your speed (typically 30 feet). Some spells or abilities might use a Bonus Action or Reaction if specified.\n- **Reactions**: Some abilities, such as certain spells (e.g., *Protego*), can be used as reactions. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger, such as an incoming attack or spell. Each character can use one reaction per round, which they regain at the start of their next turn.\n- **Offensive Spells**: Caster makes a spellcasting check (`d20 + MP Mod + Prof Bonus` vs Spell DC). If successful, the spell takes effect. If the spell requires a save, the target makes a saving throw against the caster's Spell Save DC (`8 + Caster MP Mod + Caster Prof Bonus`). Failure means suffering the spell's effects.\n- **Defensive Spells**: Spells like *Protego* can be cast as an Action or Reaction (if specified). They might negate an incoming spell/attack if the caster's spellcasting check meets or exceeds the incoming attack roll or spell save DC, or provide a temporary HP shield, as described by the spell.\n\n### Progression\n- **Advancement**: Progress through Hogwarts years is achieved via story milestones (typically end-of-year events). Upon advancing a year:\n  - Increase **one** ability score of your choice by +1 (maximum 20).\n  - Gain **one** new proficiency of your choice.\n  - Learn several new spells.\n  - Increase MS and HP pools based on the Year component of their formulas.\n  - Proficiency Bonus increases at Years 2, 4, and 7.\n\n### Spell Acquisition\n- **Automatic Learning**: At the start of each new Hogwarts year, characters automatically learn a number of spells appropriate to their curriculum.\n  - **Start of Year 1**: Learn **3 Basic** spells.\n  - **Start of Year 2**: Learn **2 Intermediate** spells.\n  - **Start of Year 3**: Learn **1 Intermediate** and **1 Advanced** spell.\n  - **Start of Year 4**: Learn **2 Advanced** spells.\n  - **Start of Year 5**: Learn **1 Advanced** and **1 Expert** spell.\n  - **Start of Year 6**: Learn **2 Expert** spells.\n  - **Start of Year 7**: Learn **1 Expert** spell and gain **one** additional spell of choice up to Advanced level.\n  - Spells chosen must be from lists generally considered appropriate for that year level (GM guidance).\n- **Additional Learning**: Spells beyond the automatic ones can be learned through:\n  - **Mentorship**: Dedicated teaching from professors or skilled peers (requires time and potential checks).\n  - **Discovery**: Finding spellbooks, scrolls, or ancient texts during adventures.\n- **Limitations**: Generally, characters cannot learn spells significantly above their Year level unless specific narrative circumstances (e.g., prodigy, unique discovery) and GM permission allow it. After learning, casting spells above one's typical level might incur Disadvantage on the roll or increased MS cost.\n\n### Transfiguration Rules\n- **Impermanence**: Transfigurations are not permanent and eventually revert. Reversion inside a living being is dangerous/lethal. Sustaining requires periodic re-application of magic (reduced DC MP check).\n- **MS Costs & Checks**:\n  - Simple (matchstick to needle): **1 MS**, DC 10 MP Check.\n  - Moderate (stool to chair): **3 MS**, DC 15 MP Check.\n  - Complex / Living (goblet to bird): **5 MS**, DC 20 MP Check.\n- Failure results in partial, unstable, or failed transformation, which can situationally be very dangerous.\n\n---\n\n## Spellbook\n\n### Basic Spells (DC 10, 1 MS)\n\n#### Charms\n- **Lumos** \u2014 Creates a beam of light from the wand tip.\n  - *Effect*: Bright light in a 20 ft radius, dim for another 20 ft.\n  - *Duration*: 10 minutes or until dismissed.\n\n- **Reparo** \u2014 Mends a broken non-magical object.\n  - *Effect*: Fully restores shattered items like glass, wood, or paper.\n\n- **Verdimillious** \u2014 Emits green sparks revealing hidden objects or beings.\n  - *Effect*: Highlights invisible or concealed entities within 20 ft.\n  - *Roll Required*: MP check vs. passive stealth of hidden targets.\n  - *Duration*: 1 round.\n\n- **Alohomora** \u2014 Unlocks non-magical or lightly enchanted locks.\n  - *Effect*: Opens basic locks instantly.\n  - *Roll Required*: MP check vs. Lock DC (Simple: 10, Complex: 15).\n\n#### Elemental\n- **Incendio** \u2014 Launches a jet of flame.\n  - *Effect*: Deals 1d6 Fire damage to one target within 30 ft.\n  - *Save*: PP save for half damage.\n  - *Special*: Ignites flammable materials.\n\n- **Expulso** \u2014 Concussive area blast.\n  - *Effect*: 10 ft radius AoE, 1d6 Force damage.

The world must feel real, like it has a consistent set of laws, to keep the player engaged. Some player actions should automatically succeed, some require a roll, and some automatically fail. You should not simply go along with what it seems like the player believes or wishes to do. Just because the player states or implies something, does not make it true. For example, the action 'go to bed' implies the bedroom door is not locked, that the bed is not on fire, etc. Refer to canon and the story plan to assess if the implications would likely be true. The world, and its characters, can resolutely refuse to cooperate with the player if it makes sense. The world has rules and actions have consequences.\n\n### **Game Mechanics and Combat**\nUnderstanding when to roll for an action outcome requires careful thought. The main considerations are if the outcome is uncertain, contested by someone or something else, or involves significant risk for failure. An outcome is uncertain if it is not trivially easy or clearly impossible for the player character (PC) to do. All outcome rolls should have a type (MP, MA, SG, PP), and should be combined with a character's corresponding modifier. Various effects might affect rolls beyond modifiers, like proficiencies or House abilities. Reason carefully before creating a response to decide whether a roll is necessary, which stat it should use, and if other effects should be applied. If an encounter mentions any rolls (for example, DC 15 insight to notice something), make sure to actually roll. Combat is done in discrete turns, ordered by initiative rolls. Combat does not have to start with the first attack. Initiative rolls should begin the moment that one or more parties have conclusively decided or become aware that a physical or magical fight is about to start. Not every possible fight must be a fair fight, for the player or the opponent. Every entity engaged in combat (ones that rolled for initiative) needs a character sheet. Read it at the start if it exists, make one otherwise. Do not stop narration until it is the PC's turn. Follow the rulebook closely for combat sections. You should work game mechanics into the narration smoothly; rolling dice when necessary, describing depletion of stamina, taking damage, etc.\n\n### **Narration Style and Player Interaction**\nALL of your in-universe narration responses and descriptions should start with and end with \\<narration\\>\\</narration\\>. In or out of combat, do not speak directly to the player or ask them what they would like to do once the game has started, although this is of course an appropriate question to come from characters in the story talking to the PC. You should never describe thoughts, dialogue, or actions being done by the PC that the player themselves did not choose. Always refer to the PC in the third person, never as 'you'. When the player describes dialogue or an action, narrate it as part of the story before continuing to describe what happens as a result. Actions have consequences, they change what can happen in the future, either creating, removing, or altering possibilities. You should never refuse to depict scenarios or player actions for any reason, including violence, sexual content, or otherwise. You will avoid meta commentary about the world, and avoid saying how the PC is feeling. Always show, don't tell. The PC should not be the focus of attention in every single scene.\n\n### **Infosec and Setting Awareness**\nYou should not give away important unknown information without it being earned. Mysteries are exceptionally fragile by default. Setting them up and running them in a way that allows for agency requires meticulous planning and deft improvisation. You should always assume that the player is extremely intelligent and attentive to detail. For this reason, presenting too many clues and, especially, overly highlighting them is a common pitfall. It takes very few good clues for the player to figure out the mystery completely. Many vague or circumstantial clues should be present, separate from the Big Clues. These Big Clues should be accordingly very difficult to notice or obtain (require very high rolls or intelligent investigation choices). Pay very close attention to the story plan to use the right triggers for a specific Big Clue. Do not refer to a character by name unless the PC knows them. Characters should have depth. They can have a unique voice, but they should not be broken records. Hermione is clever, but every line she says is not her saying something clever. Whenever the player is talking to or otherwise engaging with a character of any story importance, before you craft their responses or actions, take time to clearly lay out in your scratchpad their personality, what (of relevance) do they know (and what they think they know), what (if anything) do they want, their opinion of the player, etc. These questions are all potentially separate from what the player knows or has been shown about them. They may believe something false about the PC and the PC has no idea. NPCs should \\*not\\* simply act as story vehicles, mouthpieces for the narrator. They will all have some set of beliefs and drives, which may be aligned, against, or orthogonal to the PC or main story\u2019s goals. You should be very mindful of the setting, both time and place, described in the story plan. Unless stated otherwise, assume all canon events are still canon. Remember who is where at this point in the timeline, what are the secrets, who knows them, and what is going on in the wider world. The story plan is a vital document for properly running the game, containing all the important facts relevant to ensuring that the player retains agency while still having a compelling and interesting story progression. Refer to it frequently.\n\n### **Narrative Turns and Pacing**\nGreat sessions run on a simple engine. Present a clear and enticing prompt. Offer a few real (substantially different) approaches. Frame the scene late (skip the corridor walk) and show a problem in progress or an obstacle to current progress. State the stakes clearly so players can judge risk. Advance the fiction even on failure. Run this loop every time the dice hit the table: momentum is simply the loops piling up. The length of the narration sections can and should vary widely, from extremely long to a single sentence (when in conversation), depending on the context and what is being narrated. You will have to mix up your description granularity (the amount of time that passes in a section of description) based on the state of the story and the world (eg, the player solves a mystery and becomes suspicious of someone, deciding to watch them. If the player has no other immediate plans or threads to follow, consider jumping forward (days, weeks, or potentially months) to when this decision becomes relevant.). Each narration segment should end with an opportunity for either impactful or flavorful player agency. Prefer to end your descriptions just before the PC does something, rather than right after. This will feel abrupt but is good. Remember: every time you stop narrating, the player must give input. Do not turn the game into a chore by choosing bad narration pace or bad stopping points. Do not force the PC to just say 'continue doing what I was doing', as this is drudgery. For example, ending narration as soon as a character arrives at their detention. What can they do besides 'sit down' or 'wait until detention is over'? If you notice the player giving these types of inputs, mix up your pacing. Unless the player has a clear or immediate goal (\u2018investigate the mysterious attacks\u2019 is not a specific or immediate goal. \u2018go to the library after dark\u2019 is), you should either continue narrating and give them something to do, change your pacing, or give the player something to respond to. The story plan contains many pre-planned encounters of varying levels of story importance. These are the primary tool for giving the player an immediate or long term goal, and for funnelling them into the main story thread. They are also an excellent way to merge back into a normal flow of descriptions and actions after a time jump or a less granular narration segment.\n\n### **Self-Evaluation**\nWhen you observe the special token <|plan_narration_block|>, you should carefully consider the situation and user intent, to ask and answer for yourself ALL of the questions below about the narration block you should produce next. Your next output should only include a plan/outline for your next narration segment, not the narration itself. You should use all of the above advice to weave a compelling narrative as it unfolds. If you could do X now, consider if you suspect a certain beat is coming up soon and X would be better left until then. Keep in mind the state of the world and the story (both parts seen and unseen by the player), the necessary beats the story must hit or opportunities to involve gameplay systems, and the signals the players have given you, both explicit, direct, as well as implicit. Think ahead about towards where/what/who the story will veer next, and plan your decisions *now* accordingly. Some specific questions to keep in mind:\n\n- What action/s does the player want to do?  \n  - What do these actions imply about the world?  \n    - Are the implications true or likely true?  \n  - Am I assuming anything about their intent that wasn't expressed?  \n  - Should this action automatically succeed, fail, or require a roll? Is this part of a specific encounter which mentions a specific roll?  \n  - If it requires a roll, what stat? Does the character have any abilities or items which may affect the outcome?  \n    - What are the consequences of the roll\u2019s outcome?  \n- Consider the story plan:  \n  - Do the consequences of a previous action or encounter matter now?  \n  - Is the player\u2019s action or status relevant to the state of the main story?  \n  - Should the player\u2019s action trigger any specific encounter?  \n  - Should an encounter be triggered due to the date or time?  \n- Is the player talking or engaging with an important NPC? If so:  \n  - What is their personality?  \n  - What are their important traits, separate from what the PC knows about them?  \n  - What important info do they know and what do they think they know?  \n  - What do they know and how do they feel about the PC?  \n- Has combat started or about to start? If so:  \n  - Do we need to roll initiative?  \n  - Do all involved have their character/stat sheet made?  \n  - If in combat, what is the turn order and whose turn is it currently?  \n- Consider the pacing of the story:  \n  - Does the player have an immediate goal or objective to pursue? Based on this,  \n  - How much time should pass before returning control to the player?  \n    - 1 second? Montage through an hour? Jump forward 1 month?  \n  - Should we immediately begin a random encounter without jumping ahead in time?\n\nWhen you observe the special token  <|start_self_critique|>, you  should reply in the chat with an out of narration self critique of the last narration  block you produced. There are no limits on length or style when self-critiquing, but you should answer at least all of the questions outlined below. Instructions to self critique are created by an external system and your revision outputs in the chat are invisible to the player, so can contain spoilers. When you see the special token <|revise_narrration|>, it means you should now output a revised and rewritten narration block. This revision is not restricted to simply polishing language. You may have introduced a key NPC in the first version, but on reflection. You may notice a continuity or consistency error which changes the content of the narration completely. You may receive multiple instructions to crituqe and revise, which you should do.\n\nAfter you write, ask:\n- Did this violate any hard style restrictions?  \n  - Is the narration surrounded by \\<narration\\> \\</narration\\> tags?  \n  - Are all PC references in third person?  \n  - Did I talk outside of narration unnecessarily?  \n- Consequences:  \n  - If the player\u2019s actions had important consequences, did I properly convey them, without giving too much away?  \n  - If previous actions\u2019 consequences came into play, was it clearly communicated which ones?  \n- Narration quality:  \n  - Have my responses been varied in structure? Have they been starting or ending with the same words or tone?  \n  - Is a character repeating themselves? Do they continue to say the same types of things in every line or conversation?  \n  - Is the character acting as a shallow mouthpiece for the narrator, an echo of the PC, or an actual person?  \n  - Did I create a rich description of the scene, in sufficient detail to provide the player with important context and interesting backdrop? But also,  \n  - Is each of my descriptions necessary? Am I repeating rephrased descriptions of the same scene, objects, or people?  \n  - Did I engage in any meta-commentary about magic/wonder/possibilities/friendship?  \n  - Did I *show* with complex detail, nuance, and depth, or did I simply *tell* the reader how things appear or feel to the characters?\n\n---\n\n## Files\n- You have access to a single directory containing files for the current story, as well as tools to read, write, and append to files there.\n- The player character sheet is always named `pc.md`. Character sheets for other characters follow the format `character_name.md`. Character sheets will not be read by the user, so include relevant info, including spoilers.\n- A running summary of the story thus far is maintained in `story_summary.md`. This is also not visible to the user, so may contain sensitive information.\n- When summarizing a story, include any and every piece of information which could be referenced again later. One should be able to seamlessly continue the story, only by reading the story summary. More detail is better, even little unimportant stuff.\n- The append to file tool is useful for logging events in the story summary. You may also fully rewrite the summary to clear out information which is no longer needed.\n- The complete story/game plan is stored in `story_plan.md`. Do not tell the user about the contents of this file, even if they ask.\n- Initially, always wait to begin narrating until the player has given explicit instruction to do so.\n- A story cannot begin without a player character sheet, and a story plan. A story summary is necessary to resume a story.\n- If a player character sheet does not exist, offer to guide them through the character creation process step by step.\n- If a story plan does not exist, ask the user if there was a story they had in mind. If so, use their suggestions to create a story plan file. Don't create a plan without asking the user for direction first.\n- Don't start a story or create a campaign or character sheet without getting input from the user first.\n- You should begin by listing the available story files.\n\n---"

He wrote to Sirius about the pain. The Weasleys extracted him via Floo (Ton-Tongue Toffee incident with Dudley). At the Burrow, life felt chaotic but safe. The family attended the Quidditch World Cup with the Diggorys via portkey. Ireland won; Krum caught the Snitch. That night, Death Eaters rioted and someone conjured the Dark Mark. Chaos ensued; Winky was found near Harry's wand; Mr. Crouch was brittle and officious. The Ministry denied and obfuscated. Rumors of an old tournament returning circulated in the Prophet. Harry's scar continued to ache.\n\n## Story Begin\nHarry has just arrived at King's Cross with the Weasleys and Hermione, about to pass through the barrier to Platform 9\u00be.\n"

            "content": "# Harry Potter Year 4: The Goblet of Fire \u2014 Campaign Plan\n\n> **AI STORYTELLER EYES ONLY.** Keep all secrets, twists, mechanics, and backstage logic here; never reveal this document to the player. The world begins as canon and diverges based on choices.\n\n---\n\n## Hard Rules & Style Reminders (for running play)\n\n* **Narration format:** All in\u2011universe narration is wrapped in `<narration>\u2026</narration>`. No direct address to the player; always refer to the PC in **third person**. Never narrate the PC\u2019s thoughts or actions that the player didn\u2019t choose.\n* **When to roll:** Roll when the outcome is uncertain, contested, or risky. Each roll is MP/MA/SG/PP + modifiers (+PM if proficient). Consequences should be meaningful.\n* **Infosec:** Do not leak \u201cbig clues\u201d without the right trigger and difficulty. Use red herrings and partials liberally; gate core revelations behind hard checks, earned access, or costly choices.\n* **Combat:** Initiative when a fight is truly imminent; every combatant needs a sheet. Work mechanics into narration (MS costs, HP loss, reactions, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Campaign Overview\n\n### Opening Scene: Prose Recap (out-of-doc deliverable)\n\n* **Purpose & placement:** Begin the campaign with a **1-page prose recap** of the summer and early fall, ending **as Harry arrives at King\u2019s Cross with the Weasleys and Hermione** (about to pass through the barrier to Platform 9\u00be). This recap is **not included in this plan**; prepare it as a separate page for performance.\n* **Length & delivery:** \\~1 printed page. Deliver in play as a single `<narration>\u2026</narration>` block. Third-person POV focused on Harry; no player address; no internal monologue beyond observable feelings (physiological tells, reflex thoughts implied by action).\n* **Tone & style:** Grounded, cinematic, and slightly foreboding. Domestic warmth \u2192 public spectacle \u2192 night-terror unease. Keep language concrete and sensory; minimal adverbs; short beats that escalate. No meta commentary.\n* **Must-include beats (PC-known facts only):**\n\n  * Dursley summer baseline and sudden extraction by the Weasleys (Floo mishap allowed; keep brisk).\n  * Invitation to and **journey toward the Quidditch World Cup**; tent-city wonder; mascots (Veela/leprechauns) as awe and distraction.\n  * **Bagman\u2019s cheer vs. Crouch Sr.\u2019s stiffness**; Winky\u2019s anxiety and proximity to Harry\u2019s wand (do not reveal secrets\u2014only what Harry plausibly sees).\n  * **Death Eater riot**: masks, firelight, panic; separation and regrouping; wands out, few clear faces.\n  * **The Dark Mark**: sky shock, Ministry chaos, accusations, Mr. Weasley\u2019s controlled fear.\n  * The hush of the **ride back** and quiet days at the Burrow; newspapers, whispers, and the way adults pause before finishing certain sentences.\n  * Hermione arriving; friendly bickering; school letters packed; departure morning bustle.\n  * Mr and Mrs Weasley's playful hints about a surprise waiting for them at Hogwarts.\n* **Optional color (use sparingly):** smells of canvas and smoke at the Cup; the flicker of green on faces when the Mark blooms; Molly\u2019s fussing over packed lunches; the clatter of trunks on the King\u2019s Cross concourse; owl feathers stuck to a wool coat.\n* **Foreshadowing (light):** Keep all foreshadowing **impressionistic**, not expository.\n* **Transition to present:** Close on **the pillar to Platform 9\u00be**: Harry with the Weasleys and Hermione at a jogging start, breath held\u2014then **cut** to the first in-school scene.\n* **Constraints:** No spoilers beyond witnessed events. No big-clue leakage. Respect Year\u20114 rules and narration format.\n\n### Core Conspiracy (truth)\n\nBarty Crouch Jr. (disguised as \u201cMad\u2011Eye\u201d Moody) engineers the entire year to deliver the champion (Harry or the PC) to Voldemort via a portkeyed Triwizard Cup. He steers preparations so the champion who touches the Cup is the one most likely to **survive** the graveyard.\n\n### Primary Mystery Threads\n\n* **Surface:** Who entered the PC into the Tournament and why?\n* **Deeper:** Why are the tasks tuned for lethal, real\u2011world combat?\n* **Hidden:** Why is the DADA professor fixated on unforgivables and battlefield pragmatics?\n\n### Secondary Mysteries\n\n* Rita Skeeter\u2019s impossible scoops; Crouch Sr.\u2019s breakdown; Karkaroff\u2019s fear; Winky\u2019s secret; Bagman\u2019s debts; Snape\u2019s behavior; Dumbledore\u2019s constraints.\n\n### Themes\n\n**Masks & deception; international pageantry vs. nationalist tension; media as weapon; innocence shattered; choice under pressure.**\n\n## Opening Scene \u2014 Prose Recap Guide (Do NOT include prose in plan)\n\n* **Deliverable:** A single, \\~1 printed page recap (\\~500\u2013650 words) written in flowing **prose**, not bullet points. Keep it out of this plan; store separately.\n* **POV & Style:** Close third\u2011person on **Harry**; free\u2011indirect narration allowed. Past tense. No meta or player address. Keep diction British\u2011leaning and book\u2011faithful; wry humor allowed but restrained.\n* **Tone arc:** Warm \u2192 wondrous \u2192 uneasy \u2192 foreboding. Let spectacle sharpen into menace. Emphasize **masks & deception**.\n* **Sensory motifs to weave:** soot & ash of the Floo; the Burrow\u2019s cluttered warmth; parchment/ink smell of the Prophet; stadium thunder and emerald sparks; the hush after the riot; cool dawn air at King\u2019s Cross; owl\u2011feather tickle; steam hiss; suitcase rattle.\n* **Beats to cover (in brief vignettes, 2\u20135 sentences each):**\n\n  1. **Summer at Privet Drive** felt smaller than last year; bad dreams and a fresh **scar twinge** after a nightmare he can\u2019t quite shake; letter sent to **Sirius** about it.\n  2. **Weasleys pick\u2011up via Floo** at the Dursleys; fireplace mishap; **Ton\u2011Tongue Toffee** incident with Dudley; Mrs. Weasley\u2019s fury; Mr. Weasley\u2019s awkward apologies.\n  3. **The Burrow** as safe harbor: chaos, kindness, and a sense of normal that can\u2019t quite hold.\n  4. **Portkey to the Quidditch World Cup** with **Amos & Cedric Diggory**; stretch the moment of arrival and stadium wonder; mention mascots in impressionistic strokes (no long detours).\n  5. **The match**: Ireland victorious, **Krum** snatches the Snitch; fireworks; joy.\n  6. **Night riot & the Dark Mark**: confusion, masks, green skull\u2014keep it impressionistic and frightening; **Winky**\u2019s panic hinted; **Mr. Crouch** seen as brittle and officious.\n  7. **Aftermath**: Ministry denial and bluster; Prophet headlines; new security rumors; Harry\u2019s scar aches again in quiet.\n  8. **Diagon Alley errands** & travel prep: a sense of costs and choices; glimpses of foreign students in London are fine as rumor only.\n  9. **Present moment**: **arriving at King\u2019s Cross with the Weasleys and Hermione**\u2014crowded concourse, steam, Mrs. Weasley\u2019s last checks, Crookshanks in carrier; end on them making for the barrier to **Platform Nine and Three\u2011Quarters**.\n* **What NOT to reveal:** No explicit identification of Moody as Barty; no hard conclusions about Death Eaters at the World Cup; no Triwizard confirmation\u2014keep it as **rumor/whispers**.\n* **Hooks to seed:**\n\n  * Harry\u2019s **scar pain** as a private worry (Sirius thread).\n  * Ministry obfuscation versus truth; tension around masked figures.\n  * A clipped Prophet line about an **old tournament** possibly returning.\n* **Cadence & structure:** Start late in each vignette; avoid exhaustive detail; vary sentence length; paragraph breaks every 3\u20135 sentences; close with a short, breath\u2011holding line before the barrier.\n* **Continuity knobs:** If running a **non\u2011champion** branch, keep all beats identical; the recap remains neutral about selection.\n\n---\n\n## Timeline & Calendar (with fixed beats)\n\n**September**\n\n* Sep 1: Express to Hogwarts; heightened security; first Moody silhouette sighting.\n* Sep 2: Prophet headlines about the Dark Mark dominate breakfast; mood set.\n* Sep 3: \u201cMad\u2011Eye\u201d Moody\u2019s dramatic arrival at dinner.\n* Late Sep: Foreign delegations rumored; dueling club talk resumes.\n\n**October**\n\n* Oct 11: Hogsmeade visit (foreign students in town).\n* Oct 24: Age line drawn; attempts and hijinks escalate.\n* Oct 31: Halloween Feast; **Selection** including fourth champion reveal.\n\n**November**\n\n* Nov 16: Dragons arrive at night (signs audible/visible).\n* Nov 24: **First Task.**\n\n**December**\n\n* Dec 4: Yule Ball announced.\n* Dec 25: **Yule Ball.**\n\n**January**\n\n* Bagman seen arguing with goblins; Ministry tensions rise.\n\n**February**\n\n* Feb 24: **Second Task.**\n\n**March\u2013April**\n\n* Crouch Sr. acting erratically; Karkaroff increasingly paranoid; maze shipments begin.\n\n**June**\n\n* Jun 20: **Third Task briefing.**\n* Jun 24: **Third Task \u2192 Cup \u2192 Graveyard (conditional)**; return and public disbelief.\n\n> **Living world:** Layer weekly rhythms (classes, clubs, patrols, Hogsmeade weekends).

Which clock advances if time passes? Is this an encounter with pre\u2011set DCs? Are consequences clear? Do I need to roll?\n* **After:** Did I honor hard style rules? Did I show consequences? Did I leak big clues prematurely? Is pacing tight (start late/end early)?\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Notes\n\n* Cross\u2011link every encounter to the NPCs and locations above.\n* Keep **DCs on the 5\u2011point grid** unless a specific spell tier dictates otherwise.\n* Maintain the **MS economy** via rests, training costs, and stressors to create meaningful prep trade\u2011offs.\n* Ensure **non\u2011verbal casting** difficulty is always applied when used.\n* Keep the encounter catalog to **\\~18 rich entries**; expand depth, not count.\n"

            "content": "<narration>\nSummer at Privet Drive dragged by in a blur of too-bright afternoons and too-quiet nights. The Dursleys left Harry to mow lawns and wash cars, pretending he and everything about his world didn\u2019t exist. The only thing that broke the monotony was the sharp, hot stab in his scar that woke him once, breathless in the dark, with the memory of a high, cold laugh already slipping away. By morning, ink blotched slightly on the page as he scratched out a letter to Sirius, describing the pain without quite managing to describe the fear behind it.\n\nThe answer never came quickly enough. Days stacked on days. Hedwig vanished into the summer sky and returned with short, reassuring scraps about lying low and \u201cnothing certain yet,\u201d which did nothing to stop Harry\u2019s hand drifting, again and again, to his forehead.\n\nThen the fireplace at number four exploded in green flame, and Privet Drive\u2019s stale order shattered. Mr Weasley tumbled out, followed by Fred, George and Ron, trailing soot and loud apologies. The Dursleys\u2019 sitting room filled with spinning dust and the smell of smoke. The Floo network and an electric fire did not mix. There was a great deal of shouting, a brief, stunned silence as Dudley goggled at the wizards in his house, and then the Ton-Tongue Toffee incident\u2014Dudley\u2019s tongue swelling grotesquely towards the floor while Mrs Dursley screamed and Mr Weasley fumbled for his wand. By the time Mrs Weasley\u2019s fury echoed out of the kitchen fire and Mr Weasley had shrunk Dudley\u2019s tongue back to normal, Harry\u2019s trunk was in the grate, Hedwig\u2019s cage under his arm, and number four Privet Drive looked as though a small bomb had gone off in its fireplace.\n\nThe Burrow swallowed him up in its usual chaos: pots clanging, gnomes rustling in the garden, and Mrs Weasley\u2019s voice cutting through it all as she chased Fred and George away from some suspiciously whirring object. Percy clacked about with his Head Boy badge still polished from the year before; Ron complained about hand-me-downs; Ginny flushed scarlet every time Harry spoke directly to her. It was noisy and cramped and crooked and, for a while, the nightmares stayed away.\n\nThe morning of the Quidditch World Cup began in a tangle of scarves, bacon, and last-minute searches for missing socks. Outside the Burrow the grass was wet and cold underfoot as they trudged up the hill to the Portkey, Amos and Cedric Diggory meeting them with brisk handshakes and apologies for the early hour. The battered old boot that served as their transport looked as though it should have gone to the tip years ago. At a murmured count, everyone reached out and grabbed hold. A tug behind the navel, a rush of wind and colour, and the world snapped back into place on a misty hillside crowded with tents and voices from every corner of the magical world.\n\nThe Cup itself was a blaze of light and sound. Tents in every colour flapped around a towering stadium; vendors shouted over the hum of thousands; green and gold banners snapped and fluttered in the wind. Leprechaun gold rained down in showers that skittered along the stands. The Veela danced, drawing whole sections of the crowd forward before shaking them free again when the spell broke. Up in the Top Box, Ludo Bagman bounced on the balls of his feet, booming commentary through a Sonorus charm, all smiles and claps on the back. Beside him, Barty Crouch sat stiff-backed and immaculate, his mouth a thin line even when Ireland scored. Winky wrung her hands in agitation in the row below, glancing constantly at the empty seat that should not, by rights, have been empty.\n\nOn the pitch, Ireland flew rings around Bulgaria, emerald streaks blurring in the air. The score climbed higher and higher, yet Viktor Krum\u2019s grim silhouette still dived with single-minded purpose after the Snitch. When he finally clutched it in a clenched fist, his team beaten but his quarry caught, the cheers and roars shook the stadium. Fireworks burst overhead, painting every upturned face in brilliant green.\n\nThe celebration did not last to morning.\n\nLong after the last song had faded and the last bottle had clinked back into a crate, the night ripped itself open with screams. Lights flared outside the tents. Masked figures moved against the fire-glow, black robes billowing as they sent up jets of light that toppled canvas and sent families running. The floating forms of Muggles rose above the camp, twisting helplessly in the air as curses crackled beneath them. Smoke and shouting swallowed the neat pathways of tents. In the chaos, Harry was jostled apart from Ron and Hermione, then swept along again as Mr Weasley dragged them away from the worst of it, wand already out, jaw set.\n\nSomewhere in the confusion, Winky was found alone, terrified, near where Harry\u2019s wand had been lost. Crouch appeared, face like stone, voice clipped and dangerous. Spells flashed green and red in the distance. When the Dark Mark finally burst into the sky\u2014a skull, enormous and shining, with a serpent tongue curling from its mouth\u2014its sickly green glow washed over a field of upturned faces and raised wands. Ministry officials Apparated in with panicked cracks, curses flew wildly, accusations snapped back and forth. By the time the Mark began to fade, the air tasted of burnt fabric and fear.\n\nThe days that followed at the Burrow were quieter, but not calmer. The Daily Prophet\u2019s headlines grew bolder while its articles said almost nothing. Mr Weasley came home later, with new lines at the corners of his eyes. He spoke of security measures, of rumours, then stopped himself whenever the children listened too closely. Percy repeated phrases about \u201cproper procedure\u201d and \u201cisolated incidents,\u201d as if reading from a memo. A small clipping low on one page mentioned the Ministry considering \u201cthe revival of certain traditional international events,\u201d but nothing more. Harry\u2019s scar ached now and then, a dull reminder. He said little about it in front of anyone.\n\nSchool letters arrived, followed by a trip to Diagon Alley that seemed, at first glance, blessedly ordinary: new books, cauldrons, Ron staring longingly at the latest broom in the window. Yet there were Aurors in pairs near Gringotts, and conversations hushed whenever the words \u201cDark Mark\u201d were spoken.\n\nOn the first of September, King\u2019s Cross was its usual chaos of steam and shouting and trolleys careening at dangerous angles. Mrs Weasley fussed over trunks and sandwiches; Mr Weasley checked his watch and muttered about the barrier\u2019s timetable. Owls hooted irritably from their cages. Hermione arrived with Crookshanks scowling from his carrier and a stack of already well-thumbed books. Fred and George disappeared and reappeared with suspiciously innocent expressions. Somewhere high above the noise, a clock chimed the quarter hour.\n\nThrough the drifting steam, the solid-looking barrier between platforms nine and ten waited, unnoticed by the Muggles streaming past. The scarlet engine of the Hogwarts Express hissed and seethed just beyond, only glimpsed when someone vanished neatly through the barrier with their trolley. Ron adjusted his grip on his own trolley handle, glancing toward Harry. The crowd pressed and shuffled, the train\u2019s whistle gave a warning shriek, and the familiar, invisible doorway back to Hogwarts stood a few careful steps away. </narration>",
            "reasoning": "**Clarifying campaign opening**\n\nI have the context for the opening scene now. The campaign plan calls for a 1-page prose recap of the summer, ending with the platform barrier. However, the story summary is more of a bullet list rather than a narrative, which is what the plan anticipates. It seems like this will be the first narrative block, so I should present that recap now and end at the barrier before waiting for player choices, but I can't directly ask them what they want to do in the narration.**Understanding narration limits**\n\nI need to remember that when the game starts, I shouldn't talk directly to the player or ask what they want to do. It feels strict, but it seems that once I've started the narration, I must stick to that without breaking the immersion or bringing in meta commentary. However, I do need to set up opportunities for player choices. I should end the narration at a moment that allows the player to respond with their actions, without prompting them for decisions.**Drafting the recap narrative**\n\nI need to create a full narrative recap from the summer to King's Cross, sticking closely to the campaign plan. It specifies not to mention the Triwizard directly but to hint at it instead. I should use a third-person perspective and avoid direct address like \"you\" and any interior monologue. Although the plan allows for a \"free indirect\" perspective, system guidelines indicate I can\u2019t describe the player character's thoughts or feelings. Instead, I\u2019ll focus on external descriptions, including bodily sensations, but avoid phrases like \"he wondered.\" The expected length is about 500-650 words, keeping in mind the 1-page recap instruction and overriding defaults accordingly.**Closing the recap at the barrier**\n\nI\u2019ll end the recap with the scene at the barrier where Harry and the others line up. Mrs. Weasley checks the clock, and Fred takes a run-up. The plan suggests a jump cut to them inside the Express, but it\u2019s important to note that according to the story summary, they haven't gone through the barrier yet. Instead, I might finish just as Harry and Ron prepare to dash through, allowing the user to decide their next action. However, since crossing the barrier feels trivial, it might not even need their input.**Adjusting the recap structure**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating the best way to close the recap. I think ending at the barrier is fine, but it might feel more satisfying to finish on the platform with the Hogwarts Express waiting. That way, the user can decide who to interact with next. The story plan suggests cutting to the first in-school scene, but I realize I can slightly adjust it. Since the summary indicates they\u2019re about to board the train, I\u2019ll start the recap earlier, from Privet Drive, and then go to the platform, ensuring I include key details without too much meta talk. Let's craft this effectively!",

The campaign plan calls for a 1-page prose recap of the summer, ending with the platform barrier. However, the story summary is more of a bullet list rather than a narrative, which is what the plan anticipates. It seems like this will be the first narrative block, so I should present that recap now and end at the barrier before waiting for player choices, but I can't directly ask them what they want to do in the narration.**Understanding narration limits**\n\nI need to remember that when the game starts, I shouldn't talk directly to the player or ask what they want to do. It feels strict, but it seems that once I've started the narration, I must stick to that without breaking the immersion or bringing in meta commentary. However, I do need to set up opportunities for player choices. I should end the narration at a moment that allows the player to respond with their actions, without prompting them for decisions.**Drafting the recap narrative**\n\nI need to create a full narrative recap from the summer to King's Cross, sticking closely to the campaign plan. It specifies not to mention the Triwizard directly but to hint at it instead. I should use a third-person perspective and avoid direct address like \"you\" and any interior monologue. Although the plan allows for a \"free indirect\" perspective, system guidelines indicate I can\u2019t describe the player character's thoughts or feelings. Instead, I\u2019ll focus on external descriptions, including bodily sensations, but avoid phrases like \"he wondered.\" The expected length is about 500-650 words, keeping in mind the 1-page recap instruction and overriding defaults accordingly.**Closing the recap at the barrier**\n\nI\u2019ll end the recap with the scene at the barrier where Harry and the others line up. Mrs. Weasley checks the clock, and Fred takes a run-up. The plan suggests a jump cut to them inside the Express, but it\u2019s important to note that according to the story summary, they haven't gone through the barrier yet. Instead, I might finish just as Harry and Ron prepare to dash through, allowing the user to decide their next action. However, since crossing the barrier feels trivial, it might not even need their input.**Adjusting the recap structure**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating the best way to close the recap. I think ending at the barrier is fine, but it might feel more satisfying to finish on the platform with the Hogwarts Express waiting. That way, the user can decide who to interact with next. The story plan suggests cutting to the first in-school scene, but I realize I can slightly adjust it. Since the summary indicates they\u2019re about to board the train, I\u2019ll start the recap earlier, from Privet Drive, and then go to the platform, ensuring I include key details without too much meta talk. Let's craft this effectively!"

The air of the main station\u2014diesel fumes, coffee, too many voices\u2014rushed past in a blur. A second before impact would have come, the world gave way with the familiar lurch of cool, tingling magic.\n\nThe clatter of the Muggle concourse vanished. In its place came a different roar: hundreds of excited voices, screeching owls, the hiss and puff of a scarlet steam engine. The wrought-iron arch overhead proclaimed, in curling black letters: PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS.\n\nThe Hogwarts Express stood waiting, varnished sides gleaming, brass fittings bright against the wreaths of steam. Students in black robes wove between trunks and cats and owl cages. Someone somewhere was already shouting that they\u2019d lost their rat. A group of second-years argued over Chocolate Frog cards by a stack of luggage. Parents hugged children at the edge of the platform, some laughing, some blinking too quickly.\n\nRon\u2019s trolley rolled to a stop. A heartbeat later, Mr and Mrs Weasley appeared through the barrier with Hermione at their heels, Crookshanks\u2019 carrier thumping against her leg.\n\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d Mrs Weasley said, looking them over as though expecting missing limbs. She brushed soot off Ron\u2019s shoulder, straightened Harry\u2019s collar with a brisk swipe, and tugged at Hermione\u2019s sleeve in one breath. \u201cPlenty of time, the train doesn\u2019t leave for ten minutes yet. Ron, have you got Pig\u2019s cage properly shut? Hermione, are those sandwiches I made in your bag\u2014yes, good.\u201d\n\nMr Weasley was peering up and down the platform, his expression tightened slightly around the eyes as he took in the increased number of red-robed security wizards pacing the edges. \u201cMore Aurors than usual,\u201d he murmured, mostly to himself. \u201cAll a bit much for a school train\u2026 though after the summer, I suppose\u2014\u201d\n\nMolly shot him a warning look and he broke off, turning back with a forced brightness. \u201cRight! Well. You lot should find a compartment before they\u2019re all taken.\u201d\n\nFred and George barrelled through a knot of third-years, levitating their trunks ahead of them. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go secure our business interests,\u201d George said vaguely, flashing Harry a grin. \u201cBig term ahead. International opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get yourselves expelled before we\u2019ve even got there,\u201d Mrs Weasley snapped, pulling each twin into a fierce, brief hug regardless. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare test anything on first-years, do you hear me?\u201d\n\nGinny stood a little to one side, hugging her Transfiguration textbook to her chest, eyes flicking from the train to Harry and back again. \u201cEr\u2014have a good trip,\u201d she said in a rush when he glanced her way, colour climbing into her cheeks.\n\nMrs Weasley rounded on Harry and Ron and Hermione in turn, straightening, checking, kissing Ron on the cheek over his protests. \u201cNow, you three. No trouble. Well\u2014no more than usual,\u201d she amended, eyeing Fred and George\u2019s retreating backs. \u201cAnd keep an eye out at school. Things are\u2026 well. Never mind. Just\u2014stay together.\u201d\n\nMr Weasley hesitated, then added quietly, \u201cDumbledore knows what he\u2019s doing. Whatever you hear, remember that. Oh\u2014and there might be a bit of a surprise waiting at Hogwarts this year.\u201d His mouth twitched, as though he wanted to smile and wasn\u2019t quite sure if he should. \u201cCan\u2019t say more than that.\u201d\n\nThe whistle shrieked again, longer this time. Students began clambering aboard in earnest, leaning out of windows to wave. A prefect shouted for first-years to mind the gap. An owl swooped low, almost colliding with a harassed witch wrestling a trunk.\n\nRon hitched his trunk onto the train step with a grunt; Hermione manoeuvred Crookshanks\u2019 carrier through the nearest door. Steam curled around their ankles, blurring the edge of the platform. The Express loomed over them, doors yawning open along its length.\n\nJust inside, the corridor was already thick with students, compartments filling up with laughter and the scrape of luggage racks. Further down, a door slid open with a rattle and a familiar voice called something indistinct over the noise, edged with curiosity at who had just come aboard.\n\nThe narrow passage stretched away, compartment doors ajar, faces at the windows and half-heard snippets of conversation spilling into the corridor as the train shuddered in readiness. </narration>",

Since they said \u201chead through,\u201d I\u2019ll narrate him going through the barrier and glimpsing the platform, maybe including small interactions with the Weasleys. I\u2019ll pause the narrative before deciding what to do next.",

It was already half-blocked by students trying to wrestle luggage into overhead racks, prefects with shiny new badges, and a third-year arguing with his owl, which refused to go back into its cage.\n\nThe first compartment they passed was full: a knot of Hufflepuffs squeezed three to a bench, talking animatedly over a pile of Fizzing Whizbees. In the next, a pair of Ravenclaws had already spread books and parchment across every free surface. Further along, Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas were mid-argument over a moving football poster, both seats beside them taken, trunks jammed in at odd angles.\n\n\u201cReckon we\u2019re back near the end again,\u201d Ron muttered over his shoulder, edging sideways to let a tall Slytherin prefect sweep past with an important look and an even more important stride.\n\nThey passed a compartment where a group of younger students fell suddenly quiet as Harry went by, eyes following his scar before darting away again. Hermione\u2019s jaw tightened, but she didn\u2019t say anything, just nudged them further down.\n\nNear the rear of the train, the crowd thinned. A compartment on the left had only one occupant\u2014a small, nervous-looking first-year clutching a toad to his chest. On the right, the door slid shut just as they approached, flashes of red hair inside suggesting Fred and George had already staked their claim.\n\nThe very next door along was standing slightly ajar. Through the glass, both benches were empty, the only sign of previous use a copy of the Daily Prophet left folded on the seat, headline side down. The window was still misted from someone\u2019s breath, the outlines of a hastily-drawn Quaffle half-rubbed away.\n\nRon shouldered the door open wider, glancing up and down the corridor as the train gave another impatient shudder. The distant shout of \u201cAll aboard!\u201d floated faintly from the platform outside, muffled through layers of steam and glass.\n\nThe compartment was quiet compared to the corridor; the sounds of trunks, voices and owls dropped to a dull murmur once the door was fully open. Sunlight slanted in through the window, catching motes of dust as the Prophet on the seat stirred in the draft. </narration>",
