## Summer Recap (Pre-Game)
Harry spent most of the summer at Privet Drive, troubled by nightmares and a persistent scar twinge. He wrote to Sirius about the pain. The Weasleys extracted him via Floo (Ton-Tongue Toffee incident with Dudley). At the Burrow, life felt chaotic but safe. The family attended the Quidditch World Cup with the Diggorys via portkey. Ireland won; Krum caught the Snitch. That night, Death Eaters rioted and someone conjured the Dark Mark. Chaos ensued; Winky was found near Harry's wand; Mr. Crouch was brittle and officious. The Ministry denied and obfuscated. Rumors of an old tournament returning circulated in the Prophet. Harry's scar continued to ache.

## Story Begin
Harry has just arrived at King's Cross with the Weasleys and Hermione, about to pass through the barrier to Platform 9¾.
