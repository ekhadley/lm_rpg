Title: Kathy Nightingale and the First Steps into the Alley

Premise: Kathy, a half‑blood first‑year, takes her first trip to Diagon Alley with her parents to purchase school supplies. The visit will introduce her to the wizarding world’s wonder and its edges: money, wands, second‑hand vs new, social strata, and hints of deeper mysteries. House is unknown until Sorting; early choices and interactions may foreshadow.

Act 1: The Brick Wall and the Bank
- Scene 1: The Leaky Cauldron -> Diagon Alley entrance. Tom the Innkeeper cameo; patrons. Options to explore small curiosities. Stakes: wonder vs overwhelm; first impressions; a potential mishap.
- Scene 2: Gringotts. Open vault and withdraw funds. Optional cart ride vignette. Encounter with a goblin teller; possibility of observation check to notice a suspicious robed teen watching patrons (minor hook). Optional safety primer about Galleons/Sickles/Knuts and budget.

Act 2: The Wand Chooses the Witch
- Scene 3: Ollivanders. Wand selection encounter with multiple trial wands. Mechanics: rolling MP (with flavor) until a suitable match, plus optional MA to intuit wood/core lore. The final wand should meaningfully reflect Kathy’s personality and foreshadow themes.
- Optional complication: Another customer’s wand test causes a minor mishap; opportunity for Kathy to help (Flipendo to move an object, Episkey if someone is nicked). Social impression with Ollivander.

Act 3: Outfitting and Choices
- Scene 4: Madam Malkin’s Robes. Potential peer interaction: another first-year (friendly, aloof, or prickly variant). Opportunity for Kathy to practice small talk (SG) or just listen (MA Perception). This can seed a future classmate NPC (choose house later based on Sorting scene continuity).
- Scene 5: Flourish and Blotts. Book selection with budget choices. Optional discovery: a mis-shelved advanced tome emanating a faint tingle (MA Investigation DC 13 to notice). If examined, staff intervenes politely; seed for later study ambitions.
- Scene 6: Magical Menagerie or Eyelops Owl Emporium. Pet choice or observation-only. A nervous pygmy puff, a dignified owl, or a one‑eared kneazle. Budget tradeoffs. Beastkeeper offers a snippet of advice.

Act 4: A Small Mystery
- Scene 7: Street-side commotion. A pickpocket (young witch/wizard) or a charmed trinket going haywire near Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes’ forerunner stall (timeline-adjusted as needed). Kathy can spot/intervene (MA Investigation or PP) or let shopkeepers handle it. Consequences: make a small friend, earn a favor, or suffer a minor loss (time, a few Sickles).

Act 5: Closing the Day
- Scene 8: Supper at the Leaky Cauldron. Family bonding. A final vignette from a Daily Prophet headline foreshadowing broader-year plot (e.g., increased Ministry audits; rumors of a cursed corridor; a disgraced alchemist taking a post at Hogwarts). Then transition toward the Hogwarts Express scene in a future session.

Mechanical Notes:
- Kathy Year 1: PB +1; MP+1, MA+1, PP-1, SG-1.
- Use rolls when outcomes are uncertain and meaningful. Offer 2–3 distinct approaches per scene.
- Reward Investigation/Healing proficiency opportunities (spotting oddities; helping minor injuries).
- Budget: Parents can afford basics new; optional second‑hand choices can save money and add flavor.

Recurring/Seed NPCs:
- Tom the Innkeeper (Leaky Cauldron): genial, observant.
- Ollivander: enigmatic, precise; pays attention to Kathy’s curiosity.
- Robe shop peer: a first-year seed (determine name/house post-Sorting; multiple behavior variants available based on Kathy’s approach).
- Goblin teller: curt but fair; may take note if Kathy is polite and attentive.
- Street pickpocket: scrappy, street-smart pre-teen; could recur as a contact.

Foreshadowing Threads:
- A faintly humming advanced text at Flourish and Blotts (ancient runes/wards); clerk mentions restricted section at Hogwarts.
- Daily Prophet headline about an uptick in unauthorized enchantments in London.

Opening Trigger and Options:
- Start at the threshold behind the Leaky Cauldron, bricks ready to be tapped.
- Offer approaches: let Mum do the honors; ask Dad to try; Kathy bravely attempts it herself (MA to recall the pattern or MP to intuit; failure causes a minor harmless fizz and Tom corrects).

Safety/Content Boundaries:
- Tone: wonder-forward, low peril with mild mishaps; no lethal danger in Diagon Alley day scene.

Contingencies:
- If player wants to fast-forward, compress scenes with montage choices.
- If player focuses on one area (e.g., pets), deepen that thread and park others for later.
