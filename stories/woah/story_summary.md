Session 0 Setup:
- PC: Kathy Nightingale (she/her), Year 1 half‑blood from near Ottery St. Catchpole. Mum: Slytherin, Ministry worker, warm/protective, wants excellence. Dad: Muggle fantasy author, easygoing/funny. Kathy learned about magic ~1 year ago; ecstatic for Hogwarts but anxious about making friends. Short/scrawny, black hair in a plait; voracious reader.
- Stats: MP 12 (+1), PP 8 (-1), MA 12 (+1), SG 8 (-1). PB +1. MS 13, HP 11. Proficiencies: Healing spells, Investigation. Spells: Episkey, Flipendo, Lumos. House unknown until Sorting.
- Planned opening scene: First trip to Diagon Alley with parents to buy supplies. Start at the Leaky Cauldron back courtyard with the brick arch mechanism.
- Planned key encounters: Gringotts (vault withdrawal, possible suspicious observer), Ollivanders (wand selection), Madam Malkin’s (peer interaction), Flourish and Blotts (mis-shelved advanced tome), Owl Emporium/Magical Menagerie (pet choice), minor street commotion (pickpocket or trinket), close at Leaky Cauldron with Prophet headline foreshadowing.

Scene: Leaky Cauldron courtyard entry to Diagon Alley.
- Kathy tapped the indicated brick with her finger (no wand yet). The wall responded faintly but did not open; Tom guided her hand using his wand to complete the sequence, opening the archway. Parents present: Mum supportive/observant; Dad amused/encouraging.

- The arch opened; family stepped into Diagon Alley. Kathy chose to observe shops and people while walking. Notable visuals to present: Gringotts in the distance, Ollivanders, Madam Malkin’s, Flourish and Blotts, Owl Emporium; bustling crowd; sensory details; potential hooks (suspicious teen near Gringotts; book hum at F&B later).

- Went to Ollivanders first. Trial wands sequence:
  - Attempt 1: Failure (roll 7+1=8 vs DC12). Minor dust puff; boxes rattled.
  - Attempt 2: Failure (roll 8+1=9 vs DC13). Breeze scatters parchment.
  - Attempt 3: Success (roll 15+1=16 vs DC15). Strong resonance.
- Successful wand: proposed Willow, 10¼", pliant, unicorn hair core. Warm light and breeze; Ollivander pleased. Awaiting PC reaction/questions before purchase and details.

- In Ollivanders, Kathy remarked that the chosen wand feels different. Ollivander explained willow/unicorn traits. He invited her to try Lumos.
- Lumos test roll: 6 + MP mod 1 = 7 vs DC10 -> fail; faint flicker only. Ollivander reassured; parents reacted supportively. Wand purchased and boxed. Next destinations open: Gringotts, robes, books, pets.

- Kathy tries Lumos again with her new wand outside Ollivanders. Roll 7 + MP mod 1 = 8 vs DC10 -> fail; faint glow and sputter. MS spent 1 (current MS approx 11 after two Lumos attempts). Ollivander encourages practice; parents supportive.

- Entered Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. Tape measure fits Kathy; seamstress attends. Another first-year present as potential peer NPC (behavior TBD). Opportunity for SG small talk or MA observation.

- In Madam Malkin’s, Kathy befriended a fellow first-year named Bea (Beatrice, prefers Bea). They agreed to meet at Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour after shopping. Bea’s mum present, managing budget; Bea heading to Ollivanders next. House TBD.

- Madam Malkin completed the fitting: three sets of robes, hat, dragon-hide gloves purchased. Kathy and Bea arranged to meet at Florean Fortescue’s after errands. Inventory updated.

- Headed to Flourish and Blotts. Picked up a Daily Prophet from a street vendor; headline foreshadows uptick in unauthorized enchantments in London and Ministry audits; sidebar mentions a disgraced alchemist rumored to take a Hogwarts post.
- Investigation to notice mis-shelved advanced tome: roll 11 + MA mod 1 + PB 1 = 13 vs DC 13 -> success. Kathy notices a faintly humming advanced text misplaced among first-year books. Clerk likely intervenes politely if examined.

- At Flourish and Blotts, Kathy casually opened the unmarked grey book; faint warding runes shimmered and a cool tingle emanated. A diagram of a containment lattice flickered on the first page before a clerk intervened politely, asking not to handle restricted/archival items. Seed for later study ambitions maintained.

- At Flourish and Blotts, Kathy and parents gathered the full first-year list: Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1), A History of Magic, Magical Theory, Magical Drafts and Potions, Fantastic Beasts, The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, A Beginner’s Guide to Transfiguration. Kathy took time to browse; clerk pointed out sturdier binding.
- Kathy found a gently used copy of Magical Drafts and Potions with tidy marginalia signed "E.P."; clerk offered a small discount, parents approved. Kathy also skimmed attention-grabbing titles: "Charms and Their Counter-Charms (Illustrated)", "Beginner Wand Movements with Diagrams", "The Rune Primer" (not on list), and a pamphlet on Ministry audit guidelines for shop enchantments.

- Went to Gringotts. Observation to notice suspicious teen near steps: roll 15 + MA mod 1 = 16 vs DC ~13 -> success. Kathy spots a lanky robed teen subtly watching patrons and purses; minor hook.
- Entered bank; goblin teller curt but professional; parents handle vault withdrawal. Optional cart ride vignette to family vaults; funds secured for shopping.
