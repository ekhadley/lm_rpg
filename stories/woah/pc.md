Backstory:
- Kathy is a short, scrawny first-year with jet-black hair in a plait. She lives near Ottery St. Catchpole with her Slytherin mother (Ministry employee, warm but achievement-focused) and her Muggle father (a middlingly successful fantasy author, easygoing and funny). She learned about magic a year ago after her own accidental magic. She loves reading fantasy and sci‑fi like her dad and is ecstatic about Hogwarts, though she worries about making friends due to past loneliness at a very small school.

Personality notes:
- Curious, bookish, eager to prove herself; anxious about fitting in; warm-hearted and observant.

House Ability:
- None yet (applies after Sorting; Year 1 ability will unlock based on House).

Notes:
- First scene: First trip to Diagon Alley with her parents to get school things.
