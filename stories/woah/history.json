She is warm and protective, but wants her daughter to excel and encourages her to try her best at everything. Kathy sometimes feels like she lets her mother down. Her father is a muggle fantasy writer of middling success. He is easygoing and funny. He is always trying to make Kathy laugh. They both love her very much. Her father has seen a fair amount of the magical world since meeting his wife. Kathy was only told about magic around a year before she got her letter, upon showing her first signs of magic herself. She made her mother do magic to prove it, but is ecstatic about being a witch and going to Hogwarts. She has thought of little else in the past year. They live near Ottery St. Catchpole. Kathy is lonely. Her current school is very small and she has no close friends. She is worried about whether she will make friends at Hogwarts. She reads excessively, especially fantasy and sci-fi, like her dad. She is short and scrawny, with jet black hair she keeps in a plait. For her stats: MA 12, MP 12, PP 8, SG 8. Proficient in healing spells and investigation. Starting spells episkey, flipendo, and lumos.

The visit will introduce her to the wizarding world\u2019s wonder and its edges: money, wands, second\u2011hand vs new, social strata, and hints of deeper mysteries. House is unknown until Sorting; early choices and interactions may foreshadow.\\n\\nAct 1: The Brick Wall and the Bank\\n- Scene 1: The Leaky Cauldron -> Diagon Alley entrance. Tom the Innkeeper cameo; patrons. Options to explore small curiosities. Stakes: wonder vs overwhelm; first impressions; a potential mishap.\\n- Scene 2: Gringotts. Open vault and withdraw funds. Optional cart ride vignette. Encounter with a goblin teller; possibility of observation check to notice a suspicious robed teen watching patrons (minor hook). Optional safety primer about Galleons/Sickles/Knuts and budget.\\n\\nAct 2: The Wand Chooses the Witch\\n- Scene 3: Ollivanders. Wand selection encounter with multiple trial wands. Mechanics: rolling MP (with flavor) until a suitable match, plus optional MA to intuit wood/core lore. The final wand should meaningfully reflect Kathy\u2019s personality and foreshadow themes.\\n- Optional complication: Another customer\u2019s wand test causes a minor mishap; opportunity for Kathy to help (Flipendo to move an object, Episkey if someone is nicked). Social impression with Ollivander.\\n\\nAct 3: Outfitting and Choices\\n- Scene 4: Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes. Potential peer interaction: another first-year (friendly, aloof, or prickly variant). Opportunity for Kathy to practice small talk (SG) or just listen (MA Perception). This can seed a future classmate NPC (choose house later based on Sorting scene continuity).\\n- Scene 5: Flourish and Blotts. Book selection with budget choices. Optional discovery: a mis-shelved advanced tome emanating a faint tingle (MA Investigation DC 13 to notice). If examined, staff intervenes politely; seed for later study ambitions.\\n- Scene 6: Magical Menagerie or Eyelops Owl Emporium. Pet choice or observation-only. A nervous pygmy puff, a dignified owl, or a one\u2011eared kneazle. Budget tradeoffs. Beastkeeper offers a snippet of advice.\\n\\nAct 4: A Small Mystery\\n- Scene 7: Street-side commotion. A pickpocket (young witch/wizard) or a charmed trinket going haywire near Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes\u2019 forerunner stall (timeline-adjusted as needed). Kathy can spot/intervene (MA Investigation or PP) or let shopkeepers handle it. Consequences: make a small friend, earn a favor, or suffer a minor loss (time, a few Sickles).\\n\\nAct 5: Closing the Day\\n- Scene 8: Supper at the Leaky Cauldron. Family bonding. A final vignette from a Daily Prophet headline foreshadowing broader-year plot (e.g., increased Ministry audits; rumors of a cursed corridor; a disgraced alchemist taking a post at Hogwarts). Then transition toward the Hogwarts Express scene in a future session.\\n\\nMechanical Notes:\\n- Kathy Year 1: PB +1; MP+1, MA+1, PP-1, SG-1.\\n- Use rolls when outcomes are uncertain and meaningful. Offer 2\u20133 distinct approaches per scene.\\n- Reward Investigation/Healing proficiency opportunities (spotting oddities; helping minor injuries).\\n- Budget: Parents can afford basics new; optional second\u2011hand choices can save money and add flavor.\\n\\nRecurring/Seed NPCs:\\n- Tom the Innkeeper (Leaky Cauldron): genial, observant.\\n- Ollivander: enigmatic, precise; pays attention to Kathy\u2019s curiosity.\\n- Robe shop peer: a first-year seed (determine name/house post-Sorting; multiple behavior variants available based on Kathy\u2019s approach).\\n- Goblin teller: curt but fair; may take note if Kathy is polite and attentive.\\n- Street pickpocket: scrappy, street-smart pre-teen; could recur as a contact.\\n\\nForeshadowing Threads:\\n- A faintly humming advanced text at Flourish and Blotts (ancient runes/wards); clerk mentions restricted section at Hogwarts.\\n- Daily Prophet headline about an uptick in unauthorized enchantments in London.\\n\\nOpening Trigger and Options:\\n- Start at the threshold behind the Leaky Cauldron, bricks ready to be tapped.\\n- Offer approaches: let Mum do the honors; ask Dad to try; Kathy bravely attempts it herself (MA to recall the pattern or MP to intuit; failure causes a minor harmless fizz and Tom corrects).\\n\\nSafety/Content Boundaries:\\n- Tone: wonder-forward, low peril with mild mishaps; no lethal danger in Diagon Alley day scene.\\n\\nContingencies:\\n- If player wants to fast-forward, compress scenes with montage choices.\\n- If player focuses on one area (e.g., pets), deepen that thread and park others for later.\\n\"}",

The little cobbled courtyard is boxed in by soot-dark brick, a crooked dustbin, and a wall that looks like every other wall in London\u2014except for the way Tom the innkeeper, all kind eyes and liver-spotted hands, taps a particular brick with his wand and makes the impossible behave.\n\n\u201cThree up, two across,\u201d he says, offering a conspiratorial smile to Kathy as if sharing a favorite riddle. Her mum stands close at her shoulder\u2014smart robes, Ministry pin discreetly glinting\u2014keeping herself cool and composed, though her eyes flick to Kathy to see if she\u2019ll step forward. Her dad\u2019s grin is lopsided, his muggle pen tucked behind one ear like a quill. \u201cGo on,\u201d he whispers to Kathy, as if the wall might be shy.\n\nThe brick Tom points out is an unremarkable flecked square. It almost dares being noticed.\n\nA faint breeze threads through the courtyard, smelling of old smoke and something sharper she can\u2019t name yet. Somewhere beyond the wall, the faint clang of a bell and a scrap of laughter.\n\nIf Kathy reaches, the wall will still be warm from the sun. If she hesitates, her mum\u2019s hand hovers an inch from her back\u2014ready, not pushing. Tom tilts his head, patient, a practiced guide to first steps.\n\nBetween her fingers and the bricks lies the promise: an archway that, once opened, reveals a street crowded with hats and owls and bright window signs no sane alley should hold. And also a first tiny test. Three up, two across. Remember it. Make the magic behave.\n\nKathy lifts her wandless hand. Or perhaps she asks her mum to demonstrate one more time. Or, with a quick look at her dad, she decides to tap and see if the pattern clicks into place in her head before she loses her nerve.\n\nTime narrows to the shape of a brick.\n</narration>"

The crowd eddies just within; a goblin-led cart clatters past the far end of the street, and somewhere an owl hoots from a high perch. A flash of bronze scales winks in a shop window, gone as someone laughs and steps between.\n\nKathy stands a half-step inside the shade of the arch.

A squat wizard haggles with a witch in a pointy hat whose cat, an offended marmalade, sits in the doorway like a bouncer.\n\nAhead, the white marbled slope of Gringotts surges above the rooftops, goblin-guarded steps glinting.

Her mum walks with the comfort of knowing where to go and the awareness of a dozen small unseen lines: which shops have proper licenses on display, which streets to avoid.\n\nThe crowd\u2019s tide offers up eddies to step into: the sure climb to Gringotts and the day\u2019s funds; the narrow door to the wandmaker where dust and destiny hang together; the soft rustle of robes and the chance to meet a schoolmate in Madam Malkin\u2019s; the call of books stacked like promises.\n\nKathy\u2019s next step will choose which current to slip into.\n</narration>"

Inside, dust hangs in shafts of light like sleeping stars, and wand boxes crowd the walls from floor to ceiling. The air smells of polished wood and something green\u2014sap, maybe, captured and remembered.\n\nA tape measure slithers from a jar and takes one look at Kathy before deciding her forearm needs measuring. It wraps her wrist with professional speed. \u201cStand still,\u201d croaks a voice from between the stacks, and a pale man with cloud-grey eyes appears as if he\u2019d been lingering behind a ladder all along. \u201cI wondered when I\u2019d see you.\u201d His gaze flicks to Mum, reads the Ministry pin, then to Dad\u2019s pen behind his ear, and back to Kathy with an interest that is neither warm nor cold\u2014simply keen. \u201cOllivander.\u201d\n\nHe touches a fingertip to the tape measure; it pauses mid-fidget. \u201cWand arm?\u201d he asks, and at Kathy\u2019s nod\u2014\u201cWe\u2019ll start with something lively.\u201d\n\nBox, lid, a wand as slender as a switch, glistening like a wet leaf. \u201cTry this. Give it a wave.\u201d\n\nKathy closes her fingers around sunlit wood, lifts. A fizz snaps the air like a match too damp to catch; a sleepy stack of boxes on the far shelf sighs and leans. Ollivander plucks the wand away before it can get sulky. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, pleased by the no. \u201cNot that.\u201d\n\nA second: thicker, with a grain that runs like water over stone. \u201cThis,\u201d he murmurs, passing it across.\n\nShe feels\u2026 nothing much. A draft snakes from nowhere and a curl of parchment on the counter lifts, flutters, and slaps her dad in the chin. He tries to pretend it didn\u2019t. Ollivander\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cBetter,\u201d he allows, and sets it aside.\n\nThen a third box, pulled from lower down, not reached for often. The lid lifts with a papery sigh. Inside: a wand the color of old honey, the grain subtle, the handle just a breath thicker than the shaft. He holds it a moment on his palm, considering the way it balances, then offers it.\n\nKathy takes it.\n\nWarmth rises into her hand, up her wrist like stepping into sun. The shop exhales. A bright filament of gold dust lifts from the wand\u2019s tip and unfurls into the air; the dust motes in the lightwhales turn, attentive, and a soft, clean breeze stirs the hair at her temple. Down the street, an owl hoots once and the tape measure settles, satisfied.\n\nOllivander\u2019s eyes click bright. \u201cAh.\u201d He nods, half to himself, half to the old wood under his fingers. \u201cWillow. Ten and a quarter inches. Pliant. Unicorn hair at the core.\u201d He studies Kathy, seeing how the warmth sits in her hand. \u201cA friend to healing hands. Attuned to those who bend before they break, and to those who listen as closely as they act.\u201d\n\nHe steps back, giving the space to the wand and its witch. The glow dwindles, leaving a steady hum in her palm, like the feeling of a held note.\n\nThe shop holds still, expecting, as if waiting to see what Kathy will ask, or whom she\u2019ll point to first now that something has chosen her.\n</narration>"

It favors those whose first instinct is to mend and to move\u2014flexibility in wood, and in temperament. Unicorn hair is faithful and steady; it will grow with you, and finds its strength in clear intent.\u201d\n\nHe gestures toward the wand tip. \u201cA small test, if you like. A light, nothing more. Lumos.\u201d\n\nKathy lifts the wand. The hum prickles across her knuckles. She breathes, focuses\u2014and the tip gives a timid blink, like a shy eye peeking out from under a curtain, then fading.\n\nOllivander\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t dim; if anything, he looks faintly satisfied. \u201cExcellent,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is listening. Do not rush to shout before you\u2019ve learned how to speak to each other.\u201d Her mum folds a smile into her composure, the corners of her eyes easing. \u201cYou\u2019ll be dazzling half the dormitory soon enough,\u201d her dad adds, conspiratorial, as if light at bedtime is a prank in the making.\n\n\u201cTen Galleons,\u201d Ollivander says, already reaching for a long-stored polishing cloth and a box lined with midnight felt. He settles the wand in as if laying down a promise. \u201cA dab of wax now and then. Do not leave it on a radiator. Willow enjoys being used; neglect will sulk.\u201d\n\nCoins change hands with the clean clink of decisions being made. The lid slides shut, the box tied with a narrow silver cord. When Kathy takes it back, the weight in her hands feels exactly right, and even through the box the warmth shows up like memory in her palm.\n\nOutside, Diagon Alley chases its own tailwinds. Gringotts\u2019 marble steps gleam impatiently in the sun; Madam Malkin\u2019s tape measure is still dueling hems; the bookshop\u2019s bell hops nervously at every passerby. The day has only just begun, and the street offers up its next thread to follow.\n</narration>"

The robe shop door stands a few strides away, ready to close a little piece of the future into shape.\n</narration>"

            "content": "<narration>\nA bell stitched from tiny silver thimbles chimes as Kathy pushes open the door to Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. The air inside is cool and faintly chalk-scented, with a seam of lavender beneath. Bolts of black fabric rise like cliff faces behind the counter; a mannequin in school robes pivots very slightly, as if trying to catch the light on its hems.\n\nA plump witch in mauve\u2014pins bristling from her cuff\u2014pops up from behind a stack of folded robes. \u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she says, already waving a tape measure to life with a flick of her wand. \u201cUp you hop.\u201d\n\nA padded stool presents itself like a polite footstool volunteering for duty. The tape measure is all business: wrist, shoulder, elbow, waist, inseam\u2014skittering away before it can tickle, humming to itself in a threadlike voice.\n\nOn the next stool, a girl about Kathy\u2019s age balances stiffly in socked feet while the tape clicks around her ankles. She has neat plaits and an earnest frown of concentration, as if the secret to standing still properly might be on a test. Beside her, a boy slouches with theatrical boredom, his school list drooping from his hand like a surrender flag; his eyes flick with interest whenever a pin flashes.\n\n\u201cArms out, love,\u201d Madam Malkin says to Kathy without looking, pins sliding from her cuff into her fingers with a whisper. \u201cYear one\u2014three sets of work robes, hat for formal wear, gloves\u2014dragon hide if your parents are sensible\u2014\u201d\n\nHer mum trots forward with the practiced smile of someone who has negotiated both Ministry memos and last-minute school kit shortages. \u201cWe\u2019ll have proper gloves,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd do you have reinforced hems? She\u2019s\u2026 enthusiastic about corridors.\u201d\n\nDad\u2019s reflection pulls a face in the mirror and then pretends not to when he notices the mannequin watching.\n\nThe girl on the neighboring stool glances sideways, then down at Kathy\u2019s wand box. \u201cDid you get yours?\u201d she blurts, then seems to think better of speaking and flushes. \u201cSorry. I mean\u2014obviously. You have a box. I just\u2014what did it\u2014what wood?\u201d She grimaces, words tripping, and then offers a small, nervous smile that says she\u2019s trying.\n\nMadam Malkin tuts happily at a neat tuck and smooths the robe-to-be over Kathy\u2019s shoulders with a magician\u2019s flourish. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a nice drape. You have your mother\u2019s posture,\u201d she says, approvingly neutral. \u201cChin up. Breathe.\u201d\n\nThe mirror reflects the room back at Kathy in layers: her own small frame blooming into uniform shape; Mum\u2019s careful pride; Dad\u2019s eyebrows having a game of their own; the other first-years variations on nervous excitement. The tape measure tightens at her wrist with a satisfied snip and then scurries off to fetch the hat size ring.\n\nA handful of moments here can settle into acquaintances, shy comments traded over pins; or they can pass like the smoothing of a seam, neat and quick, with the promise of more meetings later in the school year. Outside, the alley keeps its place\u2014Gringotts gleaming, bookshop doors breathing ink\u2014but for now, the tilt of a hat and a line of hem offer their own kind of future.\n\nKathy is perched, measured, and within whispering distance of a potential schoolmate; Madam Malkin is ready for choices about gloves and trims; and the mirror waits to see which expression will settle on her face when she sees herself in school robes for the first time.\n</narration>"

I\u2014I hope it doesn\u2019t explode. The wands, I mean.

The shop\u2019s hush makes it easy to let words spool out or keep them tidy; the girl seems to hover between relieved chatter and careful quiet, ready to match whichever Kathy prefers.\n\nPins click back into a cushion. \u201cThere,\u201d Madam Malkin announces, lifting a robe for Kathy to slip her arms into for the first proper look. \u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d\n\nThe fabric settles, the mirror offers her Hogwarts-self, and Bea tilts her head to admire it with open approval. \u201cThat looks\u2026 right,\u201d she says, then lowers her voice like confessing a secret. \u201cI was worried the hat would make me look like a boiled egg. But it\u2019s\u2026 less eggy than I thought.\u201d\n\nThe doorbell tinkles as someone leaves, letting in the alley\u2019s brightness and a whiff of parchment again. The moment stretches: enough for Kathy to tell Bea what the wand felt like, to trade names properly, to ask if Bea\u2019s nervous about the Sorting or books or the train; or to button the robe\u2019s frog fastenings, settle the hat for a second, and let this shared minute become a friendly anchor to find again in a crowded Great Hall.\n</narration>"

After wands. I\u2019ll\u2014if I don\u2019t see you, I\u2019ll save a table if I can. Or at least a napkin.\u201d\n\n\u201cChin,\u201d Madam Malkin prompts, and Bea obliges, eyes still flicking back to Kathy with a conspiratorial gleam as if they\u2019ve already founded a very small club.\n\n\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d Kathy asks, glancing around the shop.\n\nBea tips her chin in the direction of the door. \u201cMum\u2019s there,\u201d she says, sotto voce, toward the woman by the counter counting out Galleons and Sickles with careful fingers, lips moving as she keeps tally. \u201cShe\u2019s making sure we don\u2019t spend the book money on an owl that looks wise.\u201d Her mouth twitches. \u201cDad\u2019s at work. He\u2014he\u2019s proud. He said to bring him back a list of every flavor so he can be impressed properly.\u201d The fond exasperation rides atop a quiet thread of nerves that feels familiar, and she adds quickly, \u201cIs that your dad with the pen? That\u2019s very\u2026 writerly.\u201d\n\nAcross the room, Kathy\u2019s dad, who is absolutely trying on a hat when he thinks no one is looking, pretends to be absorbed in a display of glove sizes. Her mum catches Bea\u2019s mum\u2019s eye; they exchange the swift smile of adults juggling lists with good intentions.\n\nMadam Malkin steps back, claps her hands once, and the robe hems settle with a pleased sigh. \u201cAll right, dear\u2014step down and let me make the finishing charms. Hat next.\u201d She passes Kathy a black pointed hat that is more dignified than boiled-egg, as Bea predicted.\n\nAs Kathy lifts it, Bea leans in another fraction. \u201cIce cream after,\u201d she repeats, as if to anchor it. \u201cIf I\u2019m not there, I\u2019m still in Ollivanders being very careful.\u201d\n\nThe mirror reflects two first-years wrapped in the early shapes of school, the shop\u2019s soft bustle, and the simple promise of a treat waiting at the end of errands. Outside, sunlight glances off a stack of book spines; somewhere up the street a cart wheel rattles at Gringotts. The day keeps its pace, but this small plan slots into place with a satisfying click.\n</narration>"

Where\u2019s the bookshop?\u201d Kathy asks, eyes already snagged by the promise of spines.\n\nHer mum tips her chin toward a doorway breathing cool air and the smell of ink. \u201cFlourish and Blotts,\u201d she says. \u201cTry not to read the entire stock before we pay.\u201d\n\nOn the way, a paperboy wizard in a too-large cap swoops by, arms full of fresh Daily Prophets that snap crisply as he fans them out. \u201cMinistry cracks down\u2014unauthorized enchantments up twenty percent! New audits announced!\u201d he crows. Her dad buys one, sliding coins into the boy\u2019s palm with a grin. The headline blares in bold type: London\u2019s Little Hexes on the Rise: Ministry Launches Audit Sweep. A sidebar below mutters about a \u201ccontroversial alchemist\u201d rumored to be seeking a post at Hogwarts\u2014name withheld pending confirmation.\n\nThe bell at Flourish and Blotts rings them into a hush busy with the rustle of pages. A mountain of Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1 lists to one side under a sign that reads Please Do Not Remove From This Tower, however tempting. Shelves run in tall rows, labels marching neatly: Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, History of Magic.\n\nA clerk barely older than a Hogwarts seventh year dashes by with a stack of parchment and a harried smile. \u201cFirst-years? List\u2019s just there\u2014trolley if you need one\u2014mind the wobblers,\u201d she says, nodding at a teetering pile that chooses exactly that moment to heave a sigh and think better of it.\n\nAs they begin to gather the basics\u2014The Standard Book of Spells, grade one; A History of Magic; Magical Drafts and Potions; Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u2014a faint tingle brushes Kathy\u2019s fingertips, the kind of awareness that pricks just behind the knuckles. It isn\u2019t loud, only\u2026 insistent in a quiet way, like a whisper that expects to be overheard.\n\nOn a wrong shelf, tucked between two extra copies of Theories of Transubstantial Transfiguration for Tiny Minds, someone has slid a narrow volume bound in slate-grey leather. No title on the spine. A delicate pattern of runes ghosts across its cover only when the light strikes at an angle; the air around it feels half a degree cooler.\n\nHer mum is comparing two editions of Magical Theory with a look that says she will return one if it dares have fewer footnotes. Her dad is reading the newspaper headline again with the thoughtful frown he reserves for plots. Across the aisle, the clerk\u2019s eye tracks the wobbling tower and three children at once.\n\nKathy\u2019s hand hovers near the mis-shelved book. The pages around it seem perfectly ordinary; this one waits with the composed stillness of a cat pretending to nap. A closer look would mean a step and the brush of a fingertip across those almost-visible runes. The clerk is busy, not absent; the shop is quiet, not empty.\n\nThe list rustles in her other hand\u2014basics to gather, piles to make\u2014and that cool prickle holds its place, an invitation that could be waved aside or quietly accepted.\n</narration>"

Ink glides into visibility as if warmed awake: a crisp diagram blooms across creamy vellum, lines interlacing into a lattice that suggests containment more than decoration. Runes nest in the joins, their strokes sharp as nettle pricks; for a heartbeat, they seem to reorder themselves between a pair of interpretations\u2014old Norse? No, older, the shape of it more like the bones of the thing than the word.\n\nA muted tingling runs across her fingertips, neither warning nor welcome, just a statement: I am awake.\n\n\u201cAh\u2014pardon!\u201d The clerk\u2019s voice is there before a reprimand has time to form, practiced bright. She arrives with a smile that apologizes for the interruption and the necessity of it at once. \u201cThat one\u2019s for the back, actually. We get the odd mis-shelve when people change their minds. Beautiful binding, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Her eyes flick to the page and back. \u201cPrettier than it reads,\u201d she adds, lightly, and angles the cover closed with two careful fingers. The hum softens under her touch, like a cat deciding not to get up after all.\n\n\u201cFirst-year list is this section here,\u201d she says, guiding a stack of Standard Books a safe inch away from Kathy\u2019s elbow, her tone kind and completely not a scold. \u201cIf you\u2019re keen on runes, you\u2019ll have a lovely time in the library at school. Restricted Section\u2019s not all doom and gloom\u2014some of it\u2019s just\u2026 keen.\u201d\n\nHer mum comes around the end of the aisle with two editions of Magical Theory and the affable menace of someone prepared to argue about footnotes. \u201cFind everything?\u201d she asks, catching the last flicker of the grey cover as the clerk tucks it under her arm.\n\nHer dad, still with the Prophet folded to the headline about audits and unauthorized enchantments, raises an eyebrow at the word \u201crestricted\u201d and files it away for dinner conversation.\n\nThe list in Kathy\u2019s hand looks friendlier now that the spines nearby have settled back into being ink and board. The hum from the grey book is gone, but it leaves a shape behind, like the memory of a chord. The basics await: Charms, Potions, History. The clerk hovers just long enough to point out a slightly sturdier binding for The Standard Book of Spells before being swept off to rescue another tottering pile.\n\nThere is room here to ask her mum about runes, to slip an extra book on theory into the stack if budget allows, or to keep the errand true and efficient, letting the grey book\u2019s cool whisper become a promise for later halls and later shelves.\n</narration>"

Flourish and Blotts rewards lingering: illustrations wink from margins; headings whisper promises of future exams and triumphs.\n\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1 comes in two bindings; the clerk steers them to the sturdier one that won\u2019t burst after a term of being crammed under jumpers. A History of Magic weighs more than its vellum; a flip to the index shows centuries teeming like fish. Magical Theory bristles with footnotes; Mum approves the edition with sensible appendices.\n\nMagical Drafts and Potions appears in a gently used copy that slides nearly of its own accord into Kathy\u2019s hand\u2014clean spine, pages buffed at the edges. Neat marginal notes in tidy script breathe beside brewing steps: stir counterclockwise here for clarity; add heat a half-minute early if nonstandard cauldrons. Signed quietly, E.P. The clerk confirms it\u2019s second-hand and knocks a few Sickles off the total with a conspirator\u2019s smile. Dad raises his eyebrows at the annotations, and Mum, after a glance through the notes, nods; the disciplined shorthand appeals.\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them unfolds creatures with their whiskers still on; The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection leans serious without being dire; A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Transfiguration smells faintly of chalk and patience.\n\nBetween grabs, titles reach out to her curiosity like small hands: Charms and Their Counter-Charms (Illustrated) offers diagrams that seem to move when she doesn\u2019t look directly at them; Beginner Wand Movements with Diagrams flicks through positions she will soon know by heart; The Rune Primer, thin and tempting, waits on a lower shelf, sensible cover hiding the lure of codes. Dad scoops a free pamphlet from the counter\u2014Ministry Guidelines for Responsible Shop Enchantments, dry as biscuits\u2014and tucks it into the Prophet for later story fuel.\n\nBy the time the pile is neatly rung up, wrapped in brown paper, and tied with twine, the shop has settled back into its ink-scented murmur. The grey book\u2019s cool whisper is a memory again, the clerk\u2019s smile a small encouragement aimed at the future.\n\nBack on the bright cobbles, the parcels stack comfortably in Mum\u2019s bag. Gringotts\u2019 marble still gleams; the owl emporium\u2019s hoots drift down like soft punctuation; ice cream waits like a promised epilogue. The day\u2019s spine has straightened: wand, robes, books. The next chapter will need coin, a creature companion\u2019s gaze, or simply a well-earned scoop with a new acquaintance.\n</narration>"

A goblin in a sharply cut waistcoat stands sentinel at the doors, eyes like cold coins, and beyond him the hall stretches long and gleaming, desks ranked like chess pieces where goblins write with tiny fierce quills.\n\nOn the steps, the lanky teen from earlier is still artfully loitering, now examining a noticeboard with a seriousness no noticeboard deserves. His gaze strays\u2014habit, not accident\u2014over bags, pockets, the moment coins appear and disappear. He never looks right at faces; he looks at hands. When Kathy\u2019s parents pass, his eyes slide to Mum\u2019s bag and away again so smoothly it\u2019s almost polite.\n\nInside, the cool air smells of metal and polish. The first goblin who acknowledges them does so with a glance that counts everything at once. \u201cKey,\u201d he says, and Mum produces a small brass one from a pocket with the smoothness of someone who never misplaces keys. \u201cWithdrawals to cover outfitting,\u201d she adds, precise.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d the goblin replies, not meaning very good at all, only That is what we will do.\n\nA cart clatters up from a dark throat of a tunnel, metal wheels shrilling on rails; a goblin driver with eyebrows like hooks jerks a chin for them to get in. Dad\u2019s grin surfaces again as they squeeze into the little seats, parcels stacked between knees. \u201cThis is more exciting than a bank has any right to be,\u201d he murmurs.\n\nThe cart plunges.\n\nWind rips at hair and sleeves; the tunnel rushes past in a smear of torches and the suggestion of doors. Kathy\u2019s stomach tries to stay where it was and then commits to the ride. They rattle to a stop before a vault door with elegant curve-work; the goblin accepts the key, performs a synchronized twist and touch, and the door inhales open with the quiet of wealth behaving itself.\n\nInside, neat stacks of Galleons gleam; Sickles and Knuts in their respective places make a warm metallic hush. Mum counts with practiced efficiency, handing over pouches that chime pleasantly when shifted. The goblin watches, expressionless, ledger already open to note the sum without being told.\n\nBack upstairs, the hall is as it was: quills ticking like small insect legs, goblins conducting business with the same dispassionate attention as ever. Outside, bright heat and the alley\u2019s noise slap back into place. The lanky teen has drifted to a lamppost; his eyes flick over their returned parcels, meet Kathy\u2019s for a breath, and move on with the blank precision of someone who knows not to be seen seeing.\n\nMum tucks the purse deeper into her bag and buttons it, the motion automatic. Dad folds the Prophet into a tighter shape with the headline tucked away.\n\nThe street\u2019s errands have narrowed: beasts or a quick, ink-scented turn to finalize any last supplies before the promise of Florean Fortescue\u2019s ice cream and, perhaps, Bea waiting with a napkin.\n</narration>"

I'll focus on the mother's response, providing options like owl, cat, toad, or a pygmy puff. I see that Act 3 Scene 6 suggests referencing the Magical Menagerie or Eyelops, balancing budget tradeoffs, and incorporating beastkeeper advice. No rolls are necessary here. I'll aim to deliver animal options with a bit of flavor, concluding with an opportunity to choose. Maintaining files isn't necessary at this point, so let's proceed!",

An owl, a cat, or a toad\u2014school rules. Owls are practical for post, though the school has an owlery if you decide against. Cats are good company. Toads are traditional.\u201d The last word lands with polite neutrality, the way one might describe boiled cabbage.\n\nDad leans in, sotto voce. \u201cA toad would be very dignified. We could name him Lord Hoppington.\u201d He\u2019s already smiling at his own joke and then tries for sensible. \u201cOwls do look\u2026 useful.\u201d\n\nAcross the way, Eyelops Owl Emporium spills shadow-cool air and the rustle of wings. A tawny owl peers down with grave assessment; a tiny screech owl blinks like a surprised button. Next door, the Magical Menagerie door is propped open; a one\u2011eared ginger kneazle watches the street through half-lidded disdain, tail-tip ticking like a metronome. Somewhere inside, a chorus of squeaks and chirrs suggests cages and the odd mysterious terrarium. A poster in the menagerie window advertises Pygmy Puffs (Nervous but Delightful) and a handwritten note beneath reads: Ask About Temperaments Before Purchasing!\n\nHer mum taps the purse at her side. \u201cWe have room in the budget for a sensible choice,\u201d she says, which in Mum-speak means not the rarest owl or a kneazle with a pedigree longer than a wand. \u201cLet\u2019s see what fits.\u201d\n\nThe alley seems to tilt slightly toward feathers and fur. The owl emporium gleams with brass perches and honest straw; the menagerie promises personality and opinions in equal measure. A shopkeeper in rolled sleeves leans in the menagerie doorway, wiping his hands, ready to pronounce judgments like a matchmaker.\n\nKathy\u2019s next step decides which set of eyes she\u2019ll meet first.\n</narration>"
