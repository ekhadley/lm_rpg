# HP Year 4 – Triwizard Campaign Plan (Canon-First, Choice-Driven)

> **Designer Note (GM-Only):** Initial world state is canon-accurate to the start of Harry’s fourth year. The plan assumes the PC is **Harry Potter**. If the player instead chooses a different PC, use the same structure: rebind triggers to that character’s proximity to events and adjust “forced” beats via fail-forward scaffolds specified below.

---

## 1) Campaign Overview

**Core conflict**: Voldemort’s restoration plot proceeds under cover of the Triwizard Tournament. A concealed agent at Hogwarts manipulates events to deliver the PC to a ritual in the graveyard.

**Themes**: spectacle vs. danger, trust and misdirection, institutions failing under pressure, media distortion, adolescent rites of passage.

**Player agency within structure**: The Tournament tasks and the graveyard ritual are **forced beats** by default, but discovery paths, preparation routes, reputation trajectories, and aftermath branches are open. Several canon scenes are now optional or semi-required, and numerous original encounters can pivot tone and difficulty.

**Mechanical posture**: Year 4 Proficiency Bonus +3 baseline; difficulty bands pre-set (Easy 5 / Moderate 10 / Hard 15 / Very Hard 20 / Extreme 25). Resource play matters: MS costs during tasks, long rests scarce on task days. Condition tracks (below) make small choices matter.

---

## 2) Story Architecture (Acts & Key Beats)

**Act 0 — Flashpoint at the Cup (Late Summer)**

* Quidditch World Cup final, post‑match riot, Dark Mark in the sky.
* Early foreshadowing; introduces Ministry dysfunction and media spin.

**Act 1 — Arrival, Announcement, Selection (September–October)**

* Durmstrang ship and Beauxbatons carriage arrive; Tournament announced; Age Line spectacle.
* **Forced**: Goblet unexpectedly selects the PC as a fourth champion.

**Act 2 — Fire and Frost (November–December)**

* **Forced**: First Task (dragon).
* Yule Ball (semi‑required; strong social branch).
* Investigations begin (Rita, Polyjuice oddities, odd staff movements).

**Act 3 — Depths and Disappearances (January–March)**

* Egg clue arc, Gillyweed alternatives, underwater networks, Crouch Sr. wanderings, Barty Jr.’s long con.
* **Forced**: Second Task (lake).

**Act 4 — Maze and Mask (May–June)**

* Web tightens (Bagman debts, Karkaroff panic, Snape’s suspicions).
* **Forced**: Third Task → Portkey to graveyard → ritual → duel → return.
* Aftermath branches: Ministry denial vs. truth campaign; Daily Prophet arc; Hogwarts morale and security fallout.

---

## 3) World-State & Timers

* **Academic calendar**: Standard Hogwarts year. Slot encounters on evenings, weekends, Hogsmeade days, and holidays.
* **Timed world events** (fire-and-forget if missed):

  * W1: Prophet front page on the Cup riot reframes events; reputation tick.
  * W6: Skeeter’s first feature on the PC.
  * W10: Crouch Sr. goes missing from Ministry duties.
  * W20: Karkaroff’s fear spikes; he avoids classes.
  * W32: Hogwarts morale drop; curfews and patrols increase.

**Condition Tracks (0–5; start at 0):**

* **Press Reputation** (Rita/Skeeter arc)
* **Authority Suspicion** (Staff/Ministry scrutiny)
* **Tournament Standing** (judges’ scores & public opinion)
* **Dark Mark Tension** (ambient fear; raises threat levels and consequences)

Each encounter details +/– deltas and thresholds that unlock or alter later scenes. At 3+ on any track, introduce complication hooks; at 5, trigger a major repercussion (e.g., detention block, article smear, security lockdown).

---

## 4) NPC Roster (GM Quick Cards)

> Full stat/skill sheets should live in per‑NPC files when combat/contested rolls are possible. Briefs below list core motive, secret knowledge, info gates, and relationship flags.

* **Albus Dumbledore** — Motive: keep students safe & truth revealed; plays long game.
  Secrets: suspects inside job but shields investigation to avoid panic.
  Gates: earnest, specific evidence; respect for student autonomy.
  Flags: +Standing boosts support in task prep.

* **“Alastor Moody” (Barty Crouch Jr.)** — Motive: deliver PC to graveyard.
  Secrets: concealed identity; manipulates task hints.
  Gates: near‑impossible to penetrate directly; clues via Polyjuice residue, trunk behavior, teaching style tics.
  Flags: High Suspicion unlocks trunk investigation branch near Act 4.

* **Barty Crouch Sr.** — Motive: preserve Ministry image; control scandal.
  Secrets: son under Imperius/Polyjuice history; compromised judgment.
  Gates: stress/illness moments; forest ramblings encounter.

* **Severus Snape** — Motive: protect his position, monitor Dark currents.
  Secrets: supplies, old allegiances, reads people well.
  Gates: respect professional conduct, avoid theatrics; hard MA/SG tests.

* **Rita Skeeter** — Motive: sensational stories.
  Secrets: unregistered beetle Animagus.
  Gates: physical capture or leverage via legal threat; Hermione angles.

* **Ludo Bagman** — Motive: maintain image, dodge debtors.
  Secrets: goblin debts, betting improprieties.
  Gates: private confrontation; leverage via witness or document.

* **Igor Karkaroff** — Motive: self‑preservation.
  Secrets: recognizes Dark Mark’s return; may flee.
  Gates: SG pressure with stakes; insecure posturing.

* **Hagrid** — Motive: help PC succeed; loves dangerous creatures.
  Secrets: dragon hint; Madame Maxime romance.
  Gates: compassion; trust‑building favors.

* **Hermione & Ron** — Motives: friendship & truth (Hermione), loyalty & pride (Ron).
  Secrets: Hermione pursues Skeeter; Ron’s jealousy arc early Act 2.
  Gates: relational choices matter for Yule Ball & research support.

* **Cedric, Fleur, Krum** — Motives: honor, pride, national pressure.
  Secrets: each has unique prep routes; cross‑champion alliances possible.

---

## 5) Systems & Running Notes

* **Year 4 baseline**: Proficiency Bonus +3; use MP/MA/PP/SG checks as appropriate.
* **Difficulty bands**: Easy 5 / Moderate 10 / Hard 15 / Very Hard 20 / Extreme 25 (applied consistently across social, exploration, academic, and combat).
* **Nonverbal**: permit at penalty; reserve for stealth duels/reactions.
* **Spell economy**: Emphasize MS costs in Tasks; short rests are rare on task days; potions & planning meaningfully alter DCs or damage.

**Task Day Scoring (for Tournament Standing):**

* Base points from judges (outcome tiers) + bonuses for flair/ingenuity (unique spell use, crowd reactions, collateral avoidance).
* Poorly handled collateral (student harm, wanton damage) increases Authority Suspicion.

### E17 (Canon, **Req**, Maj, CP) — Third Task: The Maze

* **Type**: Exploration/CP gauntlet
* **Location**: Quidditch pitch (maze)
* **Trigger**: Task day.
* **Framework**: branching nodes (fog of confusion; fear boggart variant; anti‑Apparition field); traps scale with tracks (high Tension = harsher denizens).
* **Rolls**: MA/MP 12–20 through hazards; SG 12 to coordinate with ally; PP 12 for burst sprints.
* **Outcomes**: Portkey Cup activation is the default fail‑forward endpoint. If players subvert (destroy cup or detect portkey), fail‑forward: agent swaps artifact or uses contingency Portkey touch.

---

## 7) Location Gazetteer (Play Aids)

**Hogwarts Castle (general)** — Rotating patrols, shifting stair moods; ambient checks MA 10 to pick up gossip; SG 12 to navigate social knots.
**Great Hall** — Set‑piece conversions (Ball, selection); Spectacle rules (SG checks can affect Press).
**Library & Restricted Section** — Research pipeline; librarians’ attitudes scale with Authority Suspicion.
**Grounds & Greenhouses** — Night hazards; Unseelie Motes; creature sign.
**Black Lake** — Merfolk treaties; weather complicators.
**Forbidden Forest edge** — Crouch Sr.; centaur watchfulness.
**Durmstrang Ship** — Runic heat‑engine; guarded pride.
**Beauxbatons Carriage** — Hospitality rituals; charm‑heavy ambiance.
**Hogsmeade** — Social valves; smuggler thread.

Each location lists 2–3 hooks above; cross‑reference to catalog by ID.

---

## 8) Mystery Handling & Big Clues (Gatekeeping)

Big Clues should be **earned** (high DCs, planning, or multi‑step preconditions) and scarce. Seed **decoy/pseudo clues** liberally.

**Examples (Big)**:

* Polyjuice traces in staff quarters trunk (MA 20 + SG 15 access chain).
* Inconsistency in "Moody’s" constant vigilance routine (MA 20 pattern recognition).
* Crouch Sr. rant linking names (timed + SG 15 calming).

**Examples (Vague/Decoy)**:

* Karkaroff paranoia.
* Snape night patrols.
* Bagman’s shady whispers.

Fail‑forward: Even if the agent isn’t unmasked, the graveyard still triggers; the quality of player intel affects the **Aftermath** branch power and who believes the PC post‑return.

---

## 9) Consequences & Tracks (Reference)

* **Press Reputation**: –2 (controlled Skeeter) → +2 (vicious smear).

  * Thresholds: 3 = venomous headline pre‑Task; 5 = Ministry statement against PC.
* **Authority Suspicion**: –1 to 5; at 3+ curfews/detentions block prep slots; at 5, wand checks, prefect shadows.
* **Tournament Standing**: affects crowd aid (small DC reductions) and judge leniency.
* **Dark Mark Tension**: raises encounter CR bands in night scenes; at 5 add fear effects schoolwide.

Document deltas at each encounter resolution.

---

## 10) Creature & Hazard Snippets (Task Use)

**Hungarian Horntail (abridged)**

* Resist: Slashing/Bludgeoning; Immune: Fire; Vulnerable: none.
* Attacks: Fire cone (AoE), tail sweep (Bludgeoning), bite (Piercing).
* Tactics: Nest guard AI; anger at direct line‑of‑sight; calms if egg moved out of sight.

**Grindylow Swarm**

* Pack harry; half‑damage from slashing; fear of bright force pulses.
* Hazard: entangling weeds (PP 12 escape; failure inflicts minor damage + MS tax to cast).

**Maze Hazards**

* Fear fog (SG 15 to steel nerves; failure imposes Disadvantage 1 scene).
* Misleading hedges (MA 15 to map mental grid).
* Blast‑ended Skrewts variant (CP node).

---

## 11) Forced Beats & Fail‑Forward Scaffolds

* **Selection (E03)**: Attempted refusal branches to sanctions but still yields enrollment; social costs vary.
* **Tasks (E05/E11/E17)**: Must occur; failure states inflict Standing/Authority shifts, injuries, and rumor cascades but do not stop the Tournament.
* **Graveyard (E18)**: Cup Portkey default; if neutralized, contingency Portkey or abduction triggers from “agent.” Player prevention elevates suspicion/chaos but still yields ritual via altered vector. Reward them with intel/positioning advantages even if the beat is forced.

---

## 12) End‑States (Post‑Return Branches)

* **Ministry Denial Prevails**: Hogwarts tightens security; PC isolated; Skeeter spins narrative; allies regroup in shadow.
* **Truth Edges Out**: Dumbledore moves quickly; faculty align; some public support grows; Ministry backlash delayed.
* **Public Split**: Polarized headlines; house dynamics volatile; seeds planted for a resistance network.

The achieved branch depends on Press Reputation, Authority Suspicion, and quality of evidence extracted pre‑ or post‑graveyard.

---

## 13) GM Running Tips (Quick)

* Frame scenes late; end on action decision points.
* When a roll happens, advance the fiction even on failure.
* Keep Big Clues scarce; surround with noise.
* Let social arcs (Yule Ball, Skeeter) materially alter Task DCs/aid availability.
* Use timers and curfews to make prep choices bite.

---

## 14) Setup Checklist

* Prepare per‑NPC sheets for any likely contested rolls this session.
* Print/record Condition Track values and thresholds.
* Mark calendar for Task days and timed world events.
* Stage 3–4 encounters per session: 1 anchor (often semi‑ or forced), 1–2 optional hooks, 1 wild card.
* Keep one emergency fail‑forward ready (Moody intervention, Bagman tip, Dumbledore summons) to realign cadence without railroading.

---

## 15) Living World Procedures (How to Keep It Breathing)

**Daily Loop (School Days)**

1. **Weather**: Roll 1d6 (1 fog, 2 drizzle, 3 overcast, 4 crisp clear, 5 windy, 6 storm). Apply small modifiers (e.g., windy: broom checks +2 DC; fog: stealth +1 boon, perception –1 bane).
2. **Timetable Pulse**: Pick 2 classes that matter to current prep (e.g., Charms, Potions). Offer 1 low‑stakes practical roll each day that can bank a **+1 Preparation Edge** usable once on a related future scene. Max banked Edges: 3.
3. **Rumor Mill**: Pull 1 from §17 and seed at breakfast or corridor.
4. **Patrol & Curfew**: If Authority Suspicion ≥3, increase random patrol frequency (see §19).
5. **Faction Tick**: Advance one clock in §16 if fiction points there (e.g., Skeeter prints something → Press clock +1).

**Weekend Loop**: Replace Timetable with **Electives** (Hogsmeade, Library Research, Training, Infiltration). Each elective offers a mini‑clock (2–4 segments) with a reward when filled (brew complete, contact secured, passage mapped).

**Behind‑the‑Scenes Rule**: Every time the PCs spend a day focused inward (studying, resting), advance **two** offscreen faction clocks (your choice); every time they stir the pot socially, advance **one**.

---

## 16) Faction Clocks & Agendas (6‑Segment)

* **Death Eater Ember Cell**: 0/6 → 6/6 triggers graveyard support density (adds +1 elite to E18 per 2 ticks).

  * Ticks: Masked night sighting; artifact theft; owl intercepted; Karkaroff panic monologue; curfew breach incident pinned on students.
* **Skeeter Scoop**: 0/6 → 6/6 spawns a hit‑piece series (Press Reputation +2 and Authority +1).

  * Ticks: overheard spat, photo op, anonymous tip, detention rumor, faculty whisper.
* **Goblin Patience**: 0/6 → 6/6 = formal claim served to Ministry; creates political heat at Hogwarts (Authority +1, Bagman goes to ground; E16 escalates).
* **Student Morale**: 0/6 → 6/6 toggles between **Hopeful** (Standing DCs –1) and **Sour** (random social DCs +1).

  * Ticks: task success/failure, headline tone, faculty crackdowns, feast mood.
* **Order Wakefulness (Proto)**: 0/6 → 6/6 unlocks an adult ally intervention once (Dumbledore‑aligned rescue window usable in E17 or E18).

  * Ticks: PC delivers credible evidence, rescues a student, corners Skeeter, exposes a smuggler.

> **Using Clocks**: Start most at 1/6 after the Cup riot. Advance on misses and on player choices with cost. Let players **read** a clock (MA/SG 15) to predict consequences.

---

## 17) Rumor & News Generators

**Breakfast Rumors (d8)**
1 A dragon has gone missing.
2 Durmstrang students duel at midnight—wands that spark blue.
3 House‑elves strike (for 3 minutes).
4 Krum was seen near the library’s Restricted Section with a map.
5 Peeves stole a Prefect’s badge and knighted a suit of armor.
6 Snape confiscated a scarlet vial from a Fourth Year.
7 The Beauxbatons horses ate an entire pumpkin patch.
8 Hagrid replaced class gear with… kettles?

**Truthiness (d6)**: 1–2 false, 3–4 mixed, 5 true but incomplete, 6 true with a twist.

**Rita Headline Builder**

* **Angle (d12)**: Boy‑Who‑Blunders; Secret Sweetheart; Mentor’s Pet; Dark Delinquent; Reckless Glory‑Hound; Tragic Orphan; Outsider Champion; Sly Slytherin Sympathies; Unstable Magic; House Divide; Ministry Menace; The Nation Watches.
* **Target (d10)**: PC; Dumbledore; Snape; Bagman; Krum; Fleur; Cedric; Hagrid; Karkaroff; anonymous “source.”
* **Verb (d8)**: shocks, dupes, endangers, deceives, confesses, collapses, charms, schemes.
  Combine to flavor Press Reputation shifts and social scenelets.

---

## 18) Random Scenelets & Color Beats (1–2 per day)

* **Portrait Interference**: A former Headmaster insists you show respect; SG 13 to placate or he alerts a nearby professor.
* **Staircase Mood Swing**: It waits, then lurches mid‑step; PP 12 or drop a bag (minor item loss, comedy).
* **Peeves Ambush**: Water balloons in winter; MP 12 shield or drenched (–1 to next social roll).
* **House‑Elf Gift**: Gingham‑wrapped snack appears with a note; accept for +1 Preparation Edge, or refuse and a rumor starts.
* **Slytherin Corridor Standoff**: A barbed comment; SG 14 to turn it into wit, else Authority +1 tick via prefect report.
* **Owl Post Mix‑up**: A letter meant for someone else (lead to E10 or E15).

---

## 19) Patrol Schedules & Curfews

**Base Patrol Web**: 3 loops (Filch & Mrs. Norris; two Prefect pairs). Roll 1d6 on each loop when PCs are out after hours; on a 1, crossing path in 1d4 minutes.
**Lockdown Scaling**: At Authority 3+, add a staff loop (Snape/McGonagall alternating). At 5, add an Auror visitor on task weeks.
**Detention Menu (d6)**: 1 Forbidden Forest litter duty (centaur glare), 2 trophy polishing (mischief poltergeist), 3 prep room inventory (potion whiff risk), 4 owlery mucking (a secret note!), 5 greenhouses pest pick (Unseelie mote sighting), 6 library reshelving (Restricted Section tease). Use detentions to drip clues.

---

## 20) Social Simulation: Houses & Students

* **House Lean**:

  * Gryffindor = bold aid; Ravenclaw = research boosts; Hufflepuff = logistics (cover stories, snacks, gowns); Slytherin = leverage (if respected).
* **Relationship Flags**: Track 0–5 with **key peers** (e.g., Angelina, Cho, Neville, Malfoy, Hermione, Ron). At 3+ you can call a **Favor** (once per character per act): small DC reduction, access, or cover. At 5, they’ll take a risk for you.
* **Jealousy/Glory**: After high‑profile wins, roll d6 per rival; on 1 they attempt a social undercut next day, on 6 they try to ally.

---

## 21) Downtime & Crafting Pipelines

Choose one per free afternoon/evening, roll or play out:

* **Research (Library)**: 3‑segment clock → **Insight**: pick one—reduce a known DC by 1, or unlock an alt approach (e.g., sonic charm variant for E11).
* **Brewing (Potions/Room of Requirement if found)**: 4‑segment clock → 1 potion (choose from: Water‑Breathing Draught, Numbing Balm, Focus Draught). Each potion gives a one‑use boon (e.g., treat a failed MP roll as a partial).
* **Training (Dueling Club or private)**: 3 segments → bank **Counterspell** (force one enemy spell to fizzle) or **Burst Step** (one PP reroll).
* **Infiltration (Tunnels/Faculty areas)**: 2–4 segments → map a path (–2 to future stealth DCs along that route) or plant a listening charm (1 revelation later).
* **Tutoring**: Raise a peer’s flag by 1 and gain a **Favor** IOU.

Failure fills segments slower and advances appropriate faction clocks.

---

## 22) Magic Under Pressure: Miscast Table (d12)

1 Wand sputter (spell at –2 effect).
2 Loud crack reveals position.
3 Backwash: caster suffers minor condition (–1 next roll).
4 Collateral scorch (Authority +1 tick unless contained).
5 Wild spark attracts a creature.
6 Charm rebounds (target swapped).
7 Overcharge: success but suffer 1 MS.
8 Muted effect; needs a follow‑up roll to land.
9 Component fumble; lose a small item.
10 Accidental transfiguration flicker (fun but harmless distraction).
11 Hair‑raising static; nearby portrait complains loudly.
12 Perfect surge: advantage on immediate follow‑up.

Roll when casting under chaos (riots, skirmishes) on a natural 1–2 or on failed MP by 5+.

---

## 23) Expanded Task Prep Routes (Alternatives & Costs)

**First Task (Dragon)**

* **Broom Gambit** (canon): Accio, high flight, decoy/feint. Prep: practice Accio on bulky targets (Training clock).
* **Lure & Lull**: Use creature lore (MA 15) to exploit scent/line‑of‑sight; obtain a **Smoke Kettle** from Hogsmeade smugglers (E6) for cover.
* **Ground Tunnel**: Infiltrate arena pre‑task to loosen paving stones along a line (Infiltration clock); PP 15 during task to slide‑dash.

**Second Task (Lake)**

* **Gillyweed**: Secure via E6 or Hagrid. Cost: small favor owed.
* **Bubble‑Head Charm Chain**: Research + Training clocks; higher MP DCs during task but no water‑weed penalties.
* **Runic Boiler Warmth**: Insight from E04 → resistance to cold (treat first cold penalty as ignored).
* **Merfolk Accord**: Pre‑negotiated token (SG 16 long‑form scene) allows non‑hostile passage but imposes a “no collateral” constraint (fail = Standing –1).

**Third Task (Maze)**

* **Compass Charm**: Research → reduces navigation MA DCs by 1.
* **Warding Vial**: Unseelie motes from E14 → one‑use fear fog immunity.
* **Ally Pact**: Relationship flag 5 with a champion → can coordinate for 1 scene (SG 12 each to maintain).

---

## 24) Maze Node Menu (Build Your Own Run)

Create a 12‑node pool, then deal 8 into play. Sample nodes:
1 Fog of Fear (SG 15 or Disadvantage next node).
2 Shifting Hedges (MA 15 or path loops back).
3 Skrewt Pen (CP; PP 15 to vault safely).
4 Scree Slide (PP 14; failure = ankle tweak, –1 PP until rest).
5 Silent Bell (detect magic can disarm; failure = calls a patrol construct).
6 Boggart Intersection (SG 14 to steel; clever narrative banishes).
7 Illusory Cup (MA 16 to see flaw).
8 Choking Vines (MP 15 burst or PP 15 cut).
9 Mirror Lane (SG 13 keep focus; MP 14 dispel).
10 Whisper Gate (answer riddle; wrong → time loss).
11 Soporific Pollen (PP 13 masks or nap penalty).
12 Bird‑Swarm Burst (harmless but startling; good cover to reposition).

Increase DCs by +1 if Dark Mark Tension ≥3.

## 25) Faculty Agendas & Offscreen Moves

* **Dumbledore**: quietly checks protections, interviews Crouch Sr., deploys Fawkes as courier. If the PCs bring real evidence twice, he assigns a discreet task (gain Order Wakefulness tick).
* **Snape**: audits potion stores; if theft detected, he stalks corridors near midnight (Patrol web boosted).
* **McGonagall**: shelters students post‑riot; at Authority 4+ she imposes stricter curfews (detentions spike).
* **Hagrid**: hosts covert creature‑spotting; leaks a dragon hint if treated kindly.
* **Karkaroff**: cancels Durmstrang electives; caught inspecting his arm on a fail‑forward scene.
* **Maxime**: pressures staff for fairness; can become a surprising ally if treated with respect at the Ball.
* **Bagman**: gambles on student outcomes; if cornered (E16), he trades intel for silence.

## 26) Sensory Kits (Boxed Prompts for the GM)

Use briefly to ground scenes:

* **Cup Riot**: acrid smoke, trampled grass, shrieks blending with distant cheering, a sickly green washing faces. Boots slip in spilled butterbeer.
* **Great Hall Selection**: banners sag in stunned quiet; parchment edges singed; the Goblet’s blue fades to sullen ash.
* **Yule Ball**: frost‑rimed panes; strings’ last note hanging as perfume and cinnamon punch mingle; shoes squeak on polished stone.
* **Black Lake**: numb fingertips; dull boom of strokes; silver fish flashing like coins.
* **Maze**: hedge breath; the sound‑eating hush; the taste of green, then—somewhere—a scream cut short.
* **Graveyard**: iron‑cold air; wet earth smell; a snare‑drum heart before the wand points.

---

## 27) Consequence Matrix (Cross‑Effects)

When a track shifts, consider cross‑ripples:

* **Press +2** in a week → **Authority +1** next week (staff overcorrect), **Morale –1**.
* **Authority 4+** → Training downtime harder (one fewer segment per session) but Research easier (library stays open late to “keep you out of trouble”).
* **Standing +2** on a Task → **Morale +1** and 1 free Favor roll from a random house.
* **Dark Tension 5** → add one **Night Hex** incident automatically (§12).

## 28) Session‑1 Starter Pack — King’s Cross & Hogwarts Express (Canon Start)

**Date**: 1 September (morning to dusk).
**Frame**: PCs arrive at **King’s Cross** with the Weasleys, navigate Platform 9¾, find a compartment, and ride to Hogwarts. Use this to establish tracks, relationships, and early rumors before the Sorting Feast scene‑set and staff announcements.

### A) Opening Move (Pick One to Cold‑Open)

1. **Barrier Beat**: Crowded concourse; a nervous Muggle family gawks as someone vanishes through the pillar. SG 12 to deflect attention kindly; PP 12 to time the dash; failure causes a small scene (Authority +1 tick).
2. **Prophet Peddler**: Newsboy hawks a “Quidditch Riot Fallout” edition. MA 12 to notice a contradictory sub‑headline; buying/read changes Rumor seeds and can give Press Reputation ±1 depending on public reaction to taking the paper.
3. **Platform Reunion**: Ron and Hermione have cross‑talk about the Cup; pick a stance (defiant, cautious, dismissive). Sets a Relationship flag +1 with one, –1 with the other until reconciled.

### B) Hooks on the Platform (Choose 2–3)

* **Rita on the Hunt**: Skeeter prowls near the barrier, sniffing for quotes. SG 14 to dodge; SG 16 to turn the tables with a deflecting soundbite (Press –1 later).
* **Goblin Courier**: A short, brisk goblin hands Bagman a sealed notice in plain sight (E02/E16 foreshadow). MA 12 to recognize contractual wax; PP 12 to tail briefly.
* **Lost Trunk**: A first‑year mislabels their trunk; help them and gain a small **Favor** IOU from their House.
* **Muggle Security**: A transport cop eyes the strange traffic; SG 13 to smooth; failure draws attention and a time cost.

### C) Compartment Generator (d12)

1 Empty; great for privacy.
2 Talkative Hufflepuffs with biscuits.
3 Ravenclaw study pair with a rumor board.
4 Quidditch gossipers (mention **Krum** and World Cup stats).
5 Cho passes by looking for a seat; chance for a brief, sincere exchange.
6 Fred & George with a prototype prank sweet; MP/MA to analyze safely.
7 Two nervous first‑years; protective beat.
8 Slytherin pair trading barbs; social fencing.
9 Prefect sweep mid‑journey; see §D.
10 Cat loose in the corridor; small chase (PP 11) opens a door to a clue.
11 Beauxbatons rumor enthusiasts (misinformed exchange students—actually just fashion‑forward fifth‑years).
12 A snoring wizard (harmless), but his **wand holster** is unusual (MA 13 to clock design → small bonus vs. disarms for one scene later).

### D) Prefect & Authority Web (Train‑Specific)

* **Prefect Rounds** every 45–60 minutes: roll 1d6; on 1–2 they knock. If Authority Suspicion ≥3, they return every 30 minutes and ask to see wands.
* **Responses**: Polite compliance (SG 10) keeps Authority level, cheeky banter (SG 14) risks a later revisit, defiance escalates to staff attention at the end of the journey.
* **Detention Seeds**: Record names; any corridor hexing (see §G) may convert into a first‑week detention (see §19 menu).

### E) Rumors & News (Train Edition)

Roll **one Breakfast Rumor** from §17 and convert it to **Train Talk** flavor (who said it, why they care). Then add:

* **Triwizard Whisper**: “There’s a Big Event at Hogwarts” (true but incomplete).
* **Dark Mark Echo**: “Aurors seen at Diagon Alley” (mixed).
  Truthiness: use §17’s d6 and adjust based on whether the PC read the Prophet at the platform.

### F) Trolley Interludes (d8)

1 Standard sweets; a free sample if you’re polite.
2 “Out of Chocolate Frogs, dear—try these new **Fizz Whips**” (minor Focus boon once).
3 A dropped Knut rolls under your seat; retrieving reveals a folded betting slip (E02 tie‑in).
4 “Someone reserved a pumpkin pasty under your name, love.” Who? (mystery note to be delivered at feast).
5 Loud crash two cars down—Peeves? No, a crate shifted; small commotion.
6 The trolley gets stuck; PP 12 to lift; House‑elf thanks you later with a snack (Preparation Edge +1).
7 She warns about hexing in corridors; rumor that a staff member is aboard (true: a low‑profile escort, unnamed).
8 Price dispute with a Slytherin; mediate (SG 13) or it becomes a shouting match (Press +1 if public watches the PC “grandstand,” –1 if they deftly de‑escalate).

### G) Corridor Incident (Pick or Roll Once Mid‑Journey)

* **Malfoy’s Barbs**: Classic taunt; respond: ignore (no change), cut him down with wit (SG 15, risk later payback), or duel‑spark (CP skirmish; Authority +1 tick on any spell flung).
* **Stumble & Spill**: Train jolts; MA 11 to catch trunk; failure damages an item (flavor) but reveals a hidden pocket (small clue or sweets).
* **Broken Latch**: A door won’t open; PP 12 to fix or MP 12 to charm; inside: a left‑behind Prophet with a circled name (Bagman or Crouch).

### H) Prepared Rolls & DC Ladders (Session‑1)

* **Social (SG)**: 10 cordial small talk, 13 persuasion/wit, 16 defuse public scene.
* **Magic (MP)**: 12 minor corridor charms; 15 precision (deflect spill, fix latch); 18 under stress.
* **Mind/Academics (MA)**: 10 recall Cup details, 12 spot headline inconsistencies, 15 decipher goblin seal.
* **Physical/Practical (PP)**: 10 moving through crowds, 12 time the barrier dash, 14 catch shifting luggage.

### I) Handouts (Printable)

* **Hogwarts Express Ticket**: “Platform 9¾ — 11 o’clock — 1 September” (blank line for seat/compartment).
* **Evening Prophet Clipping**: headline slots and two columns of lorem body—GM fills with Rita headline from §17.
* **Supply List Addendum**: “Due to special events this term, students may be subject to additional dress and conduct protocols” (vague; seed Yule Ball).
* **Maplet**: Simple car layout (4 cars + dining trolley), with three marked “interesting” doors (use §C results).
* **Anonymous Note Template**: small folded square with a wax‑smudged dot (“For later”).

### J) Sensory Kits (Platform & Train)

* **King’s Cross**: tannoy echoes; grease and steam; the cool stone of the pillar under palm; a burst of laughter as someone vanishes; gulls outside.
* **Express**: kettle hiss, muted clack‑clack; compartment glass trembling; sugar and pastry smells; lantern sway making freckles of light.

### K) Fail‑Forward Scaffolds (Train)

* Missed a hook? Convert it to a **Feast Cameo** (the goblin courier is now at the staff table whispering to a Ministry guest).
* Blew a social roll with Rita? She prints the angle anyway but leaves a breadcrumb (chance to flip her in §15 later).
* Authority spike onboard? Prefect gives a formal warning—no immediate detention, but **Authority Suspicion +1** at school start.

### L) Track & Flag Starters (On Arrival)

* If the PC spoke publicly on the platform (speechy), **Press Reputation +1**; if they aided first‑years or de‑escalated a spat, **Student Morale +1**.
* Record one Relationship flag +1 with either Ron or Hermione based on compartment talk choices.
* If they tangled w/ Malfoy in a hex exchange, **Authority +1** and a Slytherin rival flag +1.

### M) Session‑End Cliffhangers (Pick One)

1 The Express brakes hard; outside the window: the outline of the castle torches in mist. A Barn Owl taps with a **sealed note** (deliverable at feast).
2 Ghostly reflection in the compartment door—only when the PC stares (maze omen; harmless but eerie).
3 A prefect slides the door: “Headmaster would like a word as soon as you arrive.”
