Harry stood between platforms nine and ten with his trolley, Hedwig's cage balanced atop his trunk. The snowy owl ruffled her feathers irritably at the noise.\n\nMrs. Weasley was doing a head count for the third time, her voice carrying over the din. \"Fred - George - honestly, where's - oh there you are. Percy, mind that briefcase. Ginny, stay close dear.\" Mr. Weasley had wandered off to examine a luggage cart's brake mechanism with intense fascination.\n\nThe barrier to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters loomed ahead, that innocent-looking stretch of brick between the two platforms. A constant trickle of witches and wizards were slipping through, trying to time their passages when the Muggle crowds weren't looking. Harry noticed more were glancing around nervously than usual - the Daily Prophet tucked under several arms showed fragments of headlines about \"MINISTRY ASSURES SAFETY\" and \"WORLD CUP CHAOS.\"\n\nJust then, a sharp voice cut through the crowd near the barrier. Rita Skeeter, her jeweled spectacles glinting, had cornered what looked like a seventh-year Ravenclaw student. Her acid-green Quick-Quotes Quill was scratching away on a floating pad of parchment as she peppered the uncomfortable-looking boy with questions. \"And you were *there* when the Dark Mark appeared? How utterly *thrilling* for you...\"\n\nThe reporter's gaze swept across the crowd like a searchlight, and Harry saw the exact moment her eyes found him. Her scarlet lips curved into a predatory smile. She abandoned the Ravenclaw mid-sentence and began pushing through the crowd toward Harry, her quill practically vibrating with anticipation.\n\nRon, who had just returned from buying a Pumpkin Pasty from a vendor, followed Harry's gaze and groaned. \"Oh bloody hell, not her. Quick, we could make a run for the barrier now while she's still fighting through that family with all the owls-\"\n\nBut Skeeter was surprisingly quick in her high heels, and she'd already covered half the distance. Her photographer, a harried-looking wizard with a massive camera, struggled to keep up behind her.\n</narration>",

The scarlet Hogwarts Express sat waiting, steam billowing from its chimney. Students in robes mixed with parents giving last-minute advice. Several owls hooted from their cages. Harry's momentum carried him several feet onto the platform before he managed to stop his trolley, Hedwig giving an indignant screech at the sudden halt.\n\nHe glanced back at the barrier just in time to see Ron barrel through, looking slightly windblown. \"Brilliant timing, mate!\" Ron gasped. \"She was practically breathing down my neck. Dad's going to have to deal with her now - oh, here comes Hermione.\"\n\nHermione emerged through the barrier at a much more dignified pace, dragging her trunk, with Crookshanks' carrier balanced on top. She looked exasperated. \"Honestly, Harry, was that necessary? You nearly knocked over that poor woman with the shopping bags.\"\n\n\"Better than getting cornered by Rita Skeeter,\" Harry said, still catching his breath. Through the barrier, they could hear Mrs. Weasley's voice calling for them, though it was muffled by the magical divide.\n\nThe platform was already busy with students boarding. Near the front of the train, Harry spotted the distinctive platinum blonde hair of Draco Malfoy, surrounded by his usual crowd. Further down, a group of nervous-looking first years were being shepherded by a prefect. Someone had dropped a cage of croaking toads, causing a minor commotion as students tried to help recapture them.\n\nThe Weasley twins emerged through the barrier next, levitating their trunks with obviously illegal magic, grinning widely. \"Harry! Our hero!\" George called out. \"Leaving poor Dad to face that harpy alone!\"\n\n\"He loves Muggle small talk,\" Fred added. \"Probably asking her about the function of her dicta-quill as we speak.\"\n\nMrs. Weasley bustled through next with Ginny, looking harried. \"Honestly, Harry dear, you gave me such a fright rushing off like that! Well, never mind, better get on the train before\u2014\"\n\nA flash went off. The photographer had made it through the barrier, though Rita Skeeter was nowhere to be seen. He snapped another picture of Harry standing with his trolley before disappearing into the crowd.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" Hermione sighed. \"That'll be in tomorrow's Prophet, just watch. 'Boy Who Lived Flees Questions About Dark Mark.'\"\n\nThe train's whistle gave a warning blast. Five minutes until departure.\n</narration>",
