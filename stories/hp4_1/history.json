            "content": "<narration>\nKing\u2019s Cross breathes in steam and shoe\u2011scuff, brass fittings and the burred echo of announcements that never quite resolve into words. On the concourse, trunks rattle, owl cages blink and rustle, and a small whirlwind of red hair is engaged in a low\u2011speed collision with a luggage trolley. The twins make a jousting match of it until a mother\u2019s voice threads the bustle and brings both lances down.\n\nHarry stands within the warm orbit of the Weasleys and Hermione, the center of gravity a wicker basket, a cat carrier, and a kettle of reminders\u2014tickets, packed sandwiches, polished wands, a hand on a shoulder for a heartbeat longer than necessary. Mr Weasley rolls a pound coin over his knuckles as if it\u2019s a difficult rune. Hermione\u2019s new books are arranged in a stack so tidy even the station\u2019s dust seems to keep a respectful distance. Steam curls around them in a slow, sleeping\u2011dragon squeeze.\n\nThe summer lies underneath like paper under ink: the bare hillside before dawn, grass cold with dew, the Portkey\u2019s pull like being yanked through a keyhole. Flags, songs, a swirl of tents stitched in national colors and stitched again with magic. Then the world lit green. Smoke and shouts; masks without faces; flash\u2011bangs of spells colliding above the treeline. Mr Weasley\u2019s voice, calm because it must be, shepherding, counting. The bright shock of the Dark Mark stamped high and terrible. Later, the Ministry\u2019s self\u2011assurance mopped over charred grass, briefings spoken as if they could tidy the air. Percy\u2019s brisk, officious words like pins in a map.\n\nThere were weeks at the Burrow after, where the kitchen smelled of cinnamon and tea, where knitting needles clicked even when no hands held them, where a clock judged one\u2019s state by danger rather than hour. Molly\u2019s fussing arranged worry into tasks: eat this, wear that, write a proper letter. Fred and George conferred in corners, paper\u2011cut whispers and small alchemical pops muffled by a closed bedroom door. At night, adult voices moved in the house like weather behind walls.\n\nHermione argued with the newspapers as if they were cheeky students in need of correction. House\u2011elves came up more than once; principles were folded and refolded like an essay draft. She clipped headlines, set them beside each other, and frowned until they said what they were not saying: rumor standing on tiptoe to look like fact. A journalist\u2019s name hovered in conversations without landing; the tone was enough\u2014angles played sharper than truth, whispers turned barbs if they would sell a morning edition.\n\nThe world passed nervous notes to itself. Rumors crept in with the post: Hogwarts would host something this year, something old and grand. A championship from a century ago, perhaps. Hushed talk of \u201cproper precautions\u201d and \u201cage limits\u201d tangled with a kind of giddy dread in the letters of cousins and classmates.\n\nThis morning had the crispness of going somewhere safe you\u2019ve nevertheless had to earn. There had been the last\u2011minute wand\u2011polish, the hunt for a missing sock that had somehow folded itself into a tea towel, Mr Weasley juggling coins at a ticket barrier until a conductor\u2019s cough reminded him which pockets belonged to which world. The car ride in, hedgerows blurring, was crowded with everything unsaid. Somewhere under straw and newspaper, a white owl rearranged herself with dignified disapproval of traffic.\n\nNow the brick pillar that is not a brick pillar is ahead, two trolleys deep in front of the family caravan. The practiced ritual: aim between Platforms Nine and Ten, don\u2019t slow down, trust the impossible to be an old friend. The twins vanish first, one after the other: an ordinary magic trick induced by momentum. Mrs Weasley pats down a collar, adjusts a scarf that doesn\u2019t need adjusting. Hermione checks her watch, then tucks it away, as if to refuse the suggestion that time runs faster today.\n\nHarry leans into the pillar. Stone becomes air and shadow becomes steam. Platform Nine and Three\u2011Quarters opens like a warm drawer of winter clothes. The scarlet engine sits in a frame of its own breath, brass numbers polished bright enough to catch faces and turn them to molten ovals. The platform is a color wheel in motion: house scarves and trunks like worn wardrobes; prefects chivvying younger students toward open carriage doors; an owl\u2019s indignant hoot bouncing off the ironwork.\n\nInside the fog, signal lamps cast watery halos. A foreign accent rolls across the din, then another\u2014students in smart blue carrying single glossy trunks, a knot of broad\u2011shouldered boys in fur\u2011lined coats who glance as if measuring the platform\u2019s width with their eyes. A witch in severe plum robes clips down the line with a clipboard and a sense of schedule that makes space, briefly, around her like parted wool. By the far barrier, two Aurors stand in the veil of steam, looking not at crowds but above them, along the iron canopy where nothing is, as if in expectation.\n\nThe Weasley twins begin a spirited debate with a trolley porter about the existence of trolley permits. Ginny hugs her mother without any ceiling to it and then tries for the same with the cat carrier, which goes badly. Mr Weasley shakes a hand he has shaken every year and asks after things he already knows out of a desire to know them again. Hermione has located an open door\u2014she holds it against a tide of third\u2011years, managing somehow to keep her stack of books undisturbed.\n\nThe scar on Harry\u2019s forehead is less theatrical than memory and newspapers like to make it, just a lightning\u2011shaped line that belongs to his face the way an old crease belongs to a well\u2011used map. Steam drifts; a whistle tests its note and is satisfied. Somewhere deep in the train, a door thunks shut with the hollow certainty of journeys beginning.\n\nOn the platform immediately ahead, choices take shape in the gaps between people. There is the familiar corridor into the train where friends are waving him over, Hermione\u2019s sleeve showing just inside the doorway, a space saved like a promise. There is the slow\u2011moving knot at the far end where the foreign students have paused to stare at the engine as if it is a living animal; their chaperones exchange glances with a stiffness that doesn\u2019t belong to travel weariness. There is the pair of Aurors speaking to a station guard under the clock, sleeves cut to conceal wands and habits cut to reveal the strain of a night not slept. And there is, somewhere in the shifting column of steam to his left, a silhouette too self\u2011possessed to be a stranger\u2019s, moving with the sort of care that looks like ease.\n\nThe whistle climbs. Steam rolls low across shoe leather. The train\u2019s open step waits, its iron edge shining under a smear of soot, while the platform keeps all its unspent energy in one held breath.\n</narration>"

The platform\u2019s steam lifts in a breath, revealing her watchful face, the way her hands can\u2019t quite decide whether to fuss with his collar or his hair. He leans in and offers a goodbye, quiet enough to belong to them rather than the station.\n\nMrs Weasley\u2019s arms are around him before the last syllable fades, warm and firm and smelling of wool and cinnamon. \u201cAll right, dear,\u201d she says into his shoulder, voice steady with practice and hope. She holds him at arm\u2019s length a moment, scanning for imagined smudges and actual mischief. \u201cYou\u2019ve everything? Sandwiches in the side pocket. Don\u2019t forget to write. And if anyone gives you trouble, well\u2014\u201d her eyes flick toward the twins, who raise innocent eyebrows, \u201c\u2014you know where your friends are.\u201d\n\nMr Weasley claps his shoulder with a father\u2019s absent\u2011minded precision, as if aligning something for luck. \u201cMind the prefects and the doors,\u201d he says, then lowers his voice. \u201cAnd keep an eye open. Just\u2014generally.\u201d\n\nHermione, still anchoring the carriage door, offers the smallest of nods that somehow manages to be organizational. Fred salutes with a chocolate frog box; George pretends to rattle a collection tin for \u201ctrolley permits.\u201d Ginny lifts a hand and doesn\u2019t quite let it fall.\n\nThe whistle\u2019s second call stretches thin across the ironwork. Steam folds back into the train\u2019s flanks. Ahead, the open step remains, Hermione\u2019s sleeve a bookmark in the doorway. To the left, the two Aurors finish their quiet conference and begin to scan the platform again. Down by the foreign students, a chaperone\u2019s plum\u2011colored clipboard snaps shut. Somewhere in the steam, the smooth\u2011moving silhouette slips behind a vent of white and is gone.\n\nThe train shivers, impatient as a big cat about to rise.\n</narration>"

The carriage swallows the platform noise into a hallway of muffled thuds and warm varnish. Lamps sway in their cages, throwing honeyed ovals onto patterned runner and brass door latches. Somewhere ahead a compartment door claps shut; someone laughs; someone else shushes them with prefectly authority that almost works.\n\nHermione eases the door wider as he reaches it, and Ron\u2019s freckled grin is a flash inside before steam ghosts across the window and makes the compartment briefly their own. The rack above has room enough for a trunk and a neatly indignant owl; Hedwig\u2019s pale shape settles with a rustle that sounds like approval of this particular square of train.\n\nThrough the corridor\u2019s narrow glass, the platform edits itself into moving fragments: Mrs Weasley\u2019s scarf, a slice of Mr Weasley\u2019s profile tilted in last\u2011minute advice, the twins mock\u2011marching a trolley past a beleaguered porter. Farther down, the Beauxbatons students file past with the careful poise of those watched from many angles; one of them glances at the scarlet engine again as if verifying an entry in a book. Near the clock, the Aurors\u2019 conversation is done; their gaze moves in long arcs now, under the canopy, along the lines where a problem would first show its face.\n\nThe train gives a testing tug. The corridor sways a fraction; trunks bump their racks and settle. Voices lift in automatic farewell as if to cap the moment. The conductor\u2019s whistle slices a clean seam through the station air.\n\nInside the compartment, space arranges itself around seats and window and a tabletop with the faint carvings of years past. The corridor continues away on both sides, a river of elbows and apologies and the occasional toad. The air smells of varnish and wool and the first hint of chocolate from a trolley still six carriages back.\n\nThe platform begins to slide. Faces grow smaller in the glass. Steam draws a curtain behind the last wave. Ahead lies the long ribbon of afternoon, the rhythm of the tracks laying out choices with each jointed clack.\n\nImmediately, there\u2019s room for a decision: settle in with friends and watch the city peel away into countryside, slip back into the corridor to chase a glimpse of that too\u2011smooth silhouette before the carriages thin out, or make for the far end of the train to pass by the foreign students\u2019 compartment and eavesdrop on accents and chaperone rules as the journey takes its first true breath.\n</narration>"

Platform atmosphere tense but routine; steam, announcements, Aurors visibly present near the iron canopy.\\n- Summer recap (implicit memory): Quidditch World Cup, Dark Mark sighting, Ministry cleanup farce; weeks at the Burrow; Hermione\u2019s arguments re: house\u2011elves and press sensationalism; rumor of an \u201cold and grand\u201d event at Hogwarts this year (Triwizard implied).\\n- On Platform 9\u00be: Notable sightlines:\\n  * Two Aurors scanning above the crowd under the canopy (unusual vigilance).\\n  * Foreign students spotted (blue uniforms; fur\u2011trimmed coats); chaperone in plum robes with clipboard. They appear to be boarding/associated with the Express this year.\\n  * A \u201ctoo self\u2011possessed\u201d silhouette moving through steam; identity unknown; briefly lost behind a vent of white.\\n- Goodbyes: Mrs Weasley hugs Harry; Mr Weasley gives quiet caution (\u201ckeep an eye open\u201d). Twins banter re: \u201ctrolley permits.\u201d Ginny waves; Hermione holds carriage door.\\n- Boarding: Harry enters a compartment with Ron and Hermione; Hedwig and trunk accommodated; train departs. The platform recedes.\\n\\nOpen Threads / Leads from Scene:\\n- Investigate/observe Aurors\u2019 behavior (security changes; potential intel).\\n- Engage foreign students/chaperones on the train (open social routes; Beauxbatons/Durmstrang threads).\\n- Track the suspicious silhouette if seen on the train (possible early Moody-related flag or other plot thread).\\n- Social baseline with friends in the compartment (possible opportunity to comfort anxious younger students if they appear; could influence Professor Trust/Press later per E01).\\n\\nInventory/Resources:\\n- Standard school kit; sandwiches from Mrs Weasley; Hedwig present.\\n\\nEnvironmental Notes:\\n- Train corridor busy; trolley somewhere aft; compartments filling. Car glides into motion shortly after boarding.\\n\\nPending Choices presented to PC at handoff:\\n- Settle in the friends\u2019 compartment (observe, converse)\\n- Slip into corridor to pursue the smooth\u2011moving silhouette\\n- Pass down the train to where foreign students boarded and eavesdrop/introduce\\n\\nNo rolls made yet.

He shoulders in and claims the window bench before the next ripple of students sloshes past; the door slides shut with a sure click as Ron turns the handle. Through the glass, the corridor keeps moving\u2014blurred faces, muffled laughter, a prefect\u2019s hand held up like a stoplight for a herd of first\u2011years. Outside the window, London gives way to a rash of brick backs and then the quick dark of a tunnel.\n\nHedwig\u2019s pale shape settles on the rack with a ruffle of feathers like an approving harrumph. The compartment holds a familiar geometry: the scuffed tabletop with initials etched into the varnish, the seats that have learned their occupants\u2019 weights, the rectangular promise of hours stitched together by the rails\u2019 clack.\n\nIn the corridor beyond, a knot of second\u2011years peeks in, anxious about space; farther along, a trio in smart blue uniforms passes, their chaperone\u2019s clipped voice floating after them. For a breath, a taller figure moves past the glass with a steadiness that seems almost at odds with the train\u2019s sway, then is gone toward the next carriage. Somewhere aft, the trolley\u2019s bell tings, faint and getting closer.\n\nThe train eases out of the tunnel into a brief spill of light across rooftops. The compartment door handle taps once as a passing elbow glances off it, then stills. The moment holds\u2014quiet enough to belong to them, porous enough to let the day flow through\u2014balanced on whether to keep it that way or to crack the door to the wider journey pressing by.\n</narration>"

Dad says they\u2019ve been run ragged since the Cup. Might be the Ministry showing off, too\u2014make everyone feel better.\u201d He leans back, legs already annexing half the floor.\n\nHermione tucks a curl behind her ear. \u201cAfter the Dark Mark, increased security is hardly surprising.

The compartment settles into the gentle swing of distance. The corridor beyond holds three easy routes: wave the anxious second\u2011years in and steady their nerves while the trolley arrives, slide the door open and drift down to where Malfoy is holding court to see what he\u2019s boasting about this time, or follow the even\u2011paced shadow through the next coach before it blends completely into the journey\u2019s noise.\n</narration>"

It\u2019s tricky since characters can ask questions, but I need to avoid framing things as direct questions. Instead, I can present options narratively. For E01, there may be checks for Perception, like spotting anxious staff. Even if the player character isn\u2019t actively seeking, I\u2019m considering allowing a passive observation check. I might integrate a light MA check to notice details on the train.",

If the player character (PC) doesn\u2019t trigger those actions, then we won't roll.

In the companion book, there will be sections on countering jinxes and notes about spell cooldowns, but I\u2019ll avoid mentioning specific numbers.\n\nAs the trolley arrives, we\u2019ll include the interaction with the \u201cTrolley Witch\u201d and present options for the next action: whether to continue reading, buy from the trolley, or investigate.

            "content": "<narration>\nHarry heaves the top of his trunk open just enough to fish out a stack: The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Four sits on top, its corners tidy and unchewed; beneath it, Transfiguration\u2019s heavier volume sulks with authority, and Potions smells faintly of something sharp that has not yet met a classroom.\n\nHe cracks the Charms book. The paper is still shy of lying flat; headings march in tidy italics\u2014Summoning and Banishing Charms; Defensive Shielding, Revisited; Counter\u2011Jinx Chains in Context. Hermione has already furnished hers with small colored tabs like flags marking tiny, certain victories. When he glances, she turns the book to share a page, fingertip resting beside a footnote about line\u2011of\u2011sight and naming specificity in Summoning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about intent and identification,\u201d she says, keeping her voice to the compartment. \u201cNot just pointing and hoping. If you don\u2019t frame the object properly, you get a drawer full of trouble arriving all at once.\u201d She\u2019s not gloating; the tabs do that for her. \u201cAnd shielding isn\u2019t a wall, not really\u2014more like a timed umbrella. You can\u2019t just hold it forever.\u201d\n\nRon flips Potions open and groans as if the list of ingredients has wronged him personally. \u201cSnape\u2019s going to love that this year\u2019s all \u2018sustained temperatures\u2019 and \u2018patience\u2019,\u201d he mutters, and lets it close again to use as a coaster for his elbow.\n\nHarry skims a section on refining Expelliarmus\u2014angles, timing, the way a disarm can be used to unbalance rather than only to strip a wand. He turns a leaf and finds a spell diagram annotated in a hand not his own; Hermione makes a small noise of apology and then cannot help herself: \u201cI copied Professor Flitwick\u2019s note about stance. It makes more sense than the text.\u201d\n\nOutside the compartment, the corridor slides by in slices. A pair of second\u2011years hover at the door\u2019s glass, trying to look as if they are not hovering. The trolley\u2019s bell tings again, nearer now, followed by the soft roll and tap of wheels against the runner. Farther along, the slim blue\u2011uniformed students move as a little island, their chaperone corralling with a glance alone. Between their passing reflections, a taller figure with that same unhurried, balanced tread slips by toward the next carriage and is swallowed by the curve of the corridor.\n\nThe train\u2019s rhythm settles into that long, agreeable stretch that can belong to reading if allowed. The books offer what they always do: the promise that knowledge turns fear into shapes you can name and, sometimes, handle.\n\nThe moment holds room for choice: keep the compartment quiet and dig with Hermione into a chapter on Summoning\u2019s edge cases; crack the door to wave in the anxious second\u2011years before the trolley arrives; step out to flag down the trolley for supplies and gossip; or close the book on a finger to slip into the corridor and see what\u2019s being said\u2014by Malfoy\u2019s knot a few doors down, or by the foreign students, or by that steady silhouette that seems to treat the train as if it were standing still.\n</narration>"

Depulso imparts momentum away from a point you choose. The trick isn\u2019t force, it\u2019s control. If you push at the wrong angle, you don\u2019t disperse; you ricochet.\u201d\n\nShe flips to a diagram of a teacup accelerated off a desktop\u2014arrows showing where it should go and where it will go if someone panics. \u201cLine\u2011of\u2011sight helps both ways, but with Summoning you can use specificity to reach around obstacles. With Banishing, specificity decides direction and speed. And of course, you never try either through living things. That\u2019s banned for a reason.\u201d\n\nRon, sprawled, squints at the footnotes. \u201cSo if I \u2018banish\u2019 Snape\u2019s essay out the window\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019d be \u2018banishing\u2019 yourself to detention,\u201d Hermione says, but her mouth can\u2019t quite suppress a smile. \u201cAlso, see here\u2014shielding. Protego is timed, not continuous. If you\u2019re flinging things about, you had better be able to stop them again, or you\u2019ll learn about momentum the hard way.\u201d\n\nHarry turns a page and there\u2019s a shaded sidebar on Summoning\u2019s edge cases: conjured copies, named sets, ownership tethers. Hermione taps it with a practiced finger. \u201cYou can Accio \u2018keys,\u2019 but if you don\u2019t frame which set, you might get the nearest key\u2011like thing. And some items resist if they belong to someone else in a magically significant way. Words matter.\u201d She leans back. \u201cAnd nonverbal attempts raise the difficulty quite a lot. It can be done, but not casually.\u201d\n\nBeyond the glass, the corridor breathes on: the trolley bell tings and then again, nearer; the rack above the trolley gives a soft clink as bottles jar against one another. The pair of second\u2011years still hover, pretending not to; one of them has a Charms text open to the same chapter and keeps checking it like a passenger checks a train schedule. Past them the foreign students flow by in a self\u2011contained stream. Between their reflections, a taller figure with that same steady tread\u2014balanced and unhurried\u2014moves toward the next carriage and is gone around the bend.\n\nThe compartment has the pleasant feel of useful time. The book lies open at a page diagramming \u201ccontrolled deceleration\u201d as the complement to Banishing. There\u2019s room to press further into the theory while the trolley arrives, to slide the door open and wave in the second\u2011years for a quick, confidence\u2011bolstering chat, to collect supplies from the trolley and glean corridor gossip, or to take the book along under an arm and drift after the even\u2011paced shadow before it disappears into the long afternoon.\n</narration>"

Also, I notice that the repetition of \u201csilhouette\u201d has come up three times, so maybe it\u2019s time to drop it or escalate the narrative \u2014 like if the player doesn't follow soon, we could fade it or introduce a new event.

I did not trigger rolls because the player didn\u2019t pursue those threads yet. That\u2019s correct.\n- I could have prepped explicit check offers for immediate next choices (e.g., SG 10 to calm second-years \u2192 possible McGonagall Trust +1 per plan; Insight SG 14 to clock the silhouette\u2019s \u201ctoo smooth\u201d cadence if followed; Stealth PP 13 to eavesdrop on Malfoy). I left them implicit; this is fine until the player chooses one. When chosen, I should call the roll explicitly.\n\nConsequences\n- The action produced soft consequences: gained knowledge framing of Accio/Depulso, Protego timing, nonverbal difficulty. No trackers changed, which is appropriate for quiet study.\n- I kept the silhouette thread alive. To avoid overmilking, next beat should either escalate if pursued (call for Insight/Perception) or let it fade credibly if ignored.\n- I set up a tangible goodwill opportunity with second-years but didn\u2019t resolve it (waiting on the player choice). On selection, I should gate it behind SG 10 with a clear outcome (e.g., Professor Trust: McGonagall +1; E01 \u201cFriends Compartment\u201d path).\n\nNarration quality\n- Varied sentence lengths and sensory details (books\u2019 textures, corridor motion, trolley bell), without bloat. No repeated phrasing from earlier blocks beyond purposeful motifs (steady silhouette, trolley chime).\n- Character voices: Hermione came across as precise and engaged; Ron offered levity; both feel consistent with canon and not mouthpieces.\n- No meta commentary about magic; I showed through examples (teacup diagram, footnotes).\n- Pacing: Comfortable, reflective scene with a clear agency fork at the end. Suitable for early\u2011journey tone.\n\nContinuity and info security\n- No spoilers; the \u201csteady silhouette\u201d remains unnamed. This preserves the investigation thread per plan.\n- Hooks to foreign students and Malfoy available without forcing them.\n- Environment aligns with E01 \u201cShadows on the Express.\u201d\n\nImprovements for revision (if requested)\n- Add one crisp sensory marker tied to the silhouette (e.g., the faint clink of a flask against a coat) as a foreshadowing detail, but only if the player opts to follow and after a successful check; otherwise, keep it generic to protect the Big Clue.\n- Make the second-years\u2019 hesitation a half-line more concrete (their Charms book open to the same chapter), then explicitly offer the SG 10 check if the player invites them in.\n- If the player flags trolley interaction, provide a small rumor table and a light SG/MA roll to glean useful chatter.\n\nNo immediate revision is strictly necessary; the block is compliant and sets clean options."

He taps the page and tilts it toward Hermione without saying a word.\n\nHer eyes brighten in that quick, unguarded way they get when a problem steps into the light. \u201cBanishing is not just the inverse of Summoning,\u201d she says, settling the book between them. \u201cAccio pulls the object you\u2019ve correctly identified along the safest path to you\u2014ideally. Depulso imparts momentum away from a point you choose. The trick isn\u2019t force, it\u2019s control. If you push at the wrong angle, you don\u2019t disperse; you ricochet.\u201d\n\nShe flips to a diagram of a teacup accelerated off a desktop\u2014arrows showing where it should go and where it will go if someone panics. \u201cLine\u2011of\u2011sight helps both ways, but with Summoning you can use specificity to reach around obstacles. With Banishing, specificity decides direction and speed. And of course, you never try either through living things. That\u2019s banned for a reason.\u201d\n\nRon, sprawled, squints at the footnotes. \u201cSo if I \u2018banish\u2019 Snape\u2019s essay out the window\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019d be \u2018banishing\u2019 yourself to detention,\u201d Hermione says, but her mouth can\u2019t quite suppress a smile. \u201cAlso, see here\u2014shielding. Protego is timed, not continuous. If you\u2019re flinging things about, you had better be able to stop them again, or you\u2019ll learn about momentum the hard way.\u201d\n\nHarry turns a page and there\u2019s a shaded sidebar on Summoning\u2019s edge cases: conjured copies, named sets, ownership tethers. Hermione taps it with a practiced finger. \u201cYou can Accio \u2018keys,\u2019 but if you don\u2019t frame which set, you might get the nearest key\u2011like thing. And some items resist if they belong to someone else in a magically significant way. Words matter.\u201d She leans back. \u201cAnd nonverbal attempts raise the difficulty quite a lot. It can be done, but not casually.\u201d\n\nOutside the glass, the corridor breathes on: the trolley bell tings and then again, nearer; the rack above the trolley gives a soft clink as bottles jar against one another. The pair of second\u2011years still hover, their Charms text coincidentally open to the same chapter, eyes flicking between the page and the door like passengers checking a timetable. Past them, the blue\u2011uniformed students flow by in a self\u2011contained stream. Between their reflections, a taller figure with that same steady tread\u2014balanced and unhurried\u2014moves toward the next carriage and is swallowed by the curve of the corridor.\n\nThe compartment has the pleasant feel of useful time. The book lies open at a page diagramming \u201ccontrolled deceleration\u201d as the complement to Banishing. There\u2019s room to press further into the theory while the trolley arrives, to slide the door open and wave in the second\u2011years for a quick, confidence\u2011bolstering chat, to collect supplies from the trolley and glean corridor gossip, or to take the book along under an arm and drift after the even\u2011paced shadow before it disappears into the long afternoon.\n</narration>"
