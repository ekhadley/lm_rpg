Harry Potter RPG — Year 4 (Goblet of Fire)
Session 1 — Opening & Boarding the Express
Date: Sep 1, Year 4
Location(s): King’s Cross (Platform 9¾) → Hogwarts Express

PC: Harry James Potter (Gryffindor, Year 4). See pc.md for stats/spells.

State & Trackers (initial):
- Moody Suspicion: 0
- Press Hostility: 0
- Professor Trust: Dumbledore 0, McGonagall 0, Snape 0
- Rival Champion Grudges: Cedric 0, Fleur 0, Krum 0 (not yet encountered)

Key Events & Details:
- Arrival at King’s Cross with the Weasleys and Hermione. Platform atmosphere tense but routine; steam, announcements, Aurors visibly present near the iron canopy.
- Summer recap (implicit memory): Quidditch World Cup, Dark Mark sighting, Ministry cleanup farce; weeks at the Burrow; Hermione’s arguments re: house‑elves and press sensationalism; rumor of an “old and grand” event at Hogwarts this year (Triwizard implied).
- On Platform 9¾: Notable sightlines:
  * Two Aurors scanning above the crowd under the canopy (unusual vigilance).
  * Foreign students spotted (blue uniforms; fur‑trimmed coats); chaperone in plum robes with clipboard. They appear to be boarding/associated with the Express this year.
  * A “too self‑possessed” silhouette moving through steam; identity unknown; briefly lost behind a vent of white.
- Goodbyes: Mrs Weasley hugs Harry; Mr Weasley gives quiet caution (“keep an eye open”). Twins banter re: “trolley permits.” Ginny waves; Hermione holds carriage door.
- Boarding: Harry enters a compartment with Ron and Hermione; Hedwig and trunk accommodated; train departs. The platform recedes.

Open Threads / Leads from Scene:
- Investigate/observe Aurors’ behavior (security changes; potential intel).
- Engage foreign students/chaperones on the train (open social routes; Beauxbatons/Durmstrang threads).
- Track the suspicious silhouette if seen on the train (possible early Moody-related flag or other plot thread).
- Social baseline with friends in the compartment (possible opportunity to comfort anxious younger students if they appear; could influence Professor Trust/Press later per E01).

Inventory/Resources:
- Standard school kit; sandwiches from Mrs Weasley; Hedwig present.

Environmental Notes:
- Train corridor busy; trolley somewhere aft; compartments filling. Car glides into motion shortly after boarding.

Pending Choices presented to PC at handoff:
- Settle in the friends’ compartment (observe, converse)
- Slip into corridor to pursue the smooth‑moving silhouette
- Pass down the train to where foreign students boarded and eavesdrop/introduce

No rolls made yet. No tracker changes yet.
Action: On the train, Harry chose to stay in the compartment and pass time by browsing new school books with Hermione. They discussed upcoming coursework:
- Charms: Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4 (noted sections on Summoning/Banishing Charms and refinements to Protego/Expelliarmus chains).
- Transfiguration: intermediate material (sustaining transformations; risks of partial transfiguration; stricter theory notes).
- Defense: counter-jinx sequences and situational awareness rather than rote spells (Hermione’s take).
Environmental beats during study:
- Corridor remains active; trolley bell approaching; a group of nervous second-years lingered near the door; foreign students passed by once; the unhurried, balanced tread (suspicious silhouette) was glimpsed once more passing toward the next coach but not pursued.
No checks or tracker changes. Pending opportunities: keep studying, invite second-years in (earn minor goodwill), buy from trolley, investigate Malfoy down the corridor, or try to relocate the smooth-moving figure / foreign students for social leads.
