# Harry Potter Year 4: The Goblet of Fire — Campaign Plan (Full Rewrite)

> **AI STORYTELLER EYES ONLY.** This file contains spoilers, hidden mechanics, and mystery solutions. Do **not** reveal to the player.

---

## Hard Style Rules (Quick‑Ref)

* All in‑universe narration is wrapped in `<narration>...</narration>` and refers to the PC in **third person** only; no meta chatter outside narration; never put words in the PC’s mouth.
* Begin initiative when a fight is inevitable, not after the first strike. Never stop narration mid‑turn.
* Gate **Big Clues** behind very high DCs and/or earned conditions; surround them with lesser hints. Do not name characters the PC has not identified.
* Every narration segment ends with a clear agency point (choice or implied action). Vary description granularity aggressively.
* Use the self‑evaluation loop before/after you write; keep consequences explicit in the prose and trackers.

---

## Opening Scene — Prose Recap (Spec Only; do **not** include the prose in this plan)

* **Purpose**: Set mood, remind of recent events, and land the PC at King’s Cross with the Weasleys and Hermione, primed to board the Express and flow into E01.
* **Length**: \~1 printed page (≈500–800 words). **no dice calls**.
* **POV & Tense**: Tight third‑person on Harry; past tense; stay inside observed/remembered experience, not omniscient.
* **Tone & Voice**: Understated, British boarding‑school vibe with pressure under the surface; wry observational lines; one vivid image per paragraph; let dread leak through ordinary details; **no meta**.
* **What to Work In (beats to weave, not list)**:

  * Summer’s uneasy normal: letters/news from the wizarding world feel brittle; the scar has twinged once or twice without explanation.
  * The **Quidditch World Cup** arc in brief impressions: dawn Portkey chill, riot smoke, masked figures, the **Dark Mark** green shock; Mr Weasley’s steady‑but‑strained calm; Ministry clean‑up farce; Percy’s officiousness; a glimpse of **Winky** in turmoil (no explicit revelations).
  * Weeks at **The Burrow**: warmth and clutter; Molly’s fussing, twins’ conspiratorial tinkering; Hermione’s principled arguments over house‑elves and newspapers; small kindnesses; late‑night murmur of adults behind closed doors.
  * The **Daily Prophet** jitters and rumor‑mongering; Skeeter‑ish angles without naming her; how the wizarding world prefers a sensational headline to an honest alarm.
  * Rumors that **Hogwarts** will host something “old and grand” this year; half‑remembered talk of the **Triwizard Tournament** without rules.
  * Travel morning: breakfast bustle, last‑minute wand‑polish, Mrs Weasley’s checklist, Mr Weasley juggling Muggle coins; trunks, owl cages, Crookshanks in his carrier; Ministry‑issue anxiety riding in the car like a fifth passenger.
  * **Arrival at King’s Cross** (present moment): the echo of the concourse, announcements swallowed by steam, the Weasley twins cart‑jousting; Hermione’s tidy stack of new books; the familiarly strange moment of leaning into a brick pillar and trusting it to let you through.
* **Sensory Motifs to Thread**: steam and brass; parchment and ink; wool and smoke; green torchlight memory of the Mark; cinnamon and tea at the Burrow; the station’s iron and echo; owl rustle.
* **Structure** (paragraph‑level flow):

  1. Present‑tense arrival snap to hook → slide back into summer’s texture.
  2. World Cup vignette → riot → Mark → Ministry aftermath → Burrow solace.
  3. Rumors/Prophet pressure → small domestic beats with Hermione/Weasleys.
  4. Return to the station now → barrier to 9¾ → the scarlet engine revealed.
  5. Land on a quiet, charged line that hands control to the player.
* **Safety/Infosec**: Do **not** name or reveal Big Clues (no Crouch Jr., no beetle animagus).
* **Mechanics Hooks**: Soft‑seed tracker context but don’t set values: press anxiety in the air; adults’ guardedness; Harry’s determination vs. unease. Do **not** adjust trackers during recap.
* **Hand‑off** Simply ask if the user is ready to begin.



## Mechanics Quick‑Ref (Rules Consistency)

* **Stats**: MP, PP, MA, SG; **PM** by year; **HP/MS** ≈ `10 + 2·Year + Mod`.
* **Spell tiers** (defaults): Basic DC 10 / 1 MS; Intermediate 15 / 3 MS; Advanced 20 / 5 MS; Expert 25 / 7 MS. Adjust only for environment or advantage/disadvantage.
* **Nonverbal casting**: add **+7 DC** (or **+4** if proficient in Nonverbal Casting).
* **House Year‑4 callouts** (embed when relevant):

  * **Gryffindor — Swish & Flick** (once/encounter two offensive spells).
  * **Hufflepuff — Perseverance** (cast at 0 MS by paying HP per tier).
  * **Ravenclaw — Eureka** (1/scene ask for one correct inference or reduce a puzzle DC by 3).
  * **Slytherin — Resourceful Magic** (1/scene convert a social success into tangible advantage: +1 forward, item, or route).
* **Saves/Checks** always declared with the stat and preset DC. No ad‑hoc mechanics: translate everything into checks, saves, conditions, or environment.

## Campaign Overview

### Core Conspiracy

Barty Crouch Jr. (as “Moody”) manipulates the year to deliver a champion to the graveyard for Voldemort’s resurrection. The tournament tasks are engineered as survival training.

### Primary Mystery Threads

* Why does “Moody” coach the PC toward Dark‑War doctrine?

* **Rival Champion Grudge (0–3 each)**: Fleur, Krum, Cedric; influences aid, sabotage, and task behaviors.

> Consequence tags: **Immediate / Session‑Delay / Long‑Burn**. Note tags at the end of every encounter.

## NPC Roster (files separate; brief hooks here)

**Alastor “Moody” (Barty Jr.)** — DADA professor impostor; polyjuice cadence; flask schedule; trains for battlefield doctrine; info‑gates: behavior inconsistencies, trunk/keys, polyjuice trail.

**Albus Dumbledore** — constrained by Tournament compacts; wary of Moody; unlocks advanced help if trust ≥ +1.

**Severus Snape** — burning Mark; potion trails; suspicious of Moody yet cagey. Offers veiled aid at trust ≥ 0.

**Ludo Bagman** — goblin debt; leaks task info for favors.

**Rita Skeeter** — illegal beetle animagus; blackmail files; leverage with proof.

**Dobby & Winky** — elf network omnipresent; Winky’s staged disclosures only (no full dump without high DC + conditions).

**Champions**: Cedric, Fleur, Krum — each with relationship levers that affect task behaviors.

## Encounter Mix Check

* **Count**: 16 (meets 10–20 guideline).
* **Priority distribution**: F = 5 (31%), SR = 6 (38%), O = 5 (31%).
* **Type mix (primary classification)**: Combat‑Req ≈ 1 (E05); Combat‑Possible ≈ 6 (E07, E09, E13, E14, E16, E17); Social ≈ 6 (E01, E02, E03, E06, E11, E12); Exploration/Mystery ≈ 3 (E07, E10, E16); Academic ≈ 2 (E04, E08). (Some scenes blend categories by design.)

---

## MS/HP Economy & Recovery Placement

* **Per‑Task expected MS pressure**: First 5–10; Second 8–12; Third 10–15; Graveyard 15–20.
* **Prep costs**: Intensive training 3 MS/day; all‑nighters 4 MS; emotional stress 1–2 MS.
* **Recovery hooks**: Hospital Wing (post‑task), Kitchens (Pepperup/potions gating), Library rest (low‑noise +1 MS on study days). House potions or staff aid require **Professor Trust ≥ +1**.

---

## Big‑Clue Gating Policy (Examples)

* Winky disclosures require: private setting + intoxicated + SG 18 **and** prior Crouch‑thread flag; otherwise only hints (family disgrace, “bad master”).
* Trunk secret requires: Polyjuice cadence discovered **and** office search (Investigation 18) **and** key condition; Big Clue DCs 20–25.
* Rita’s beetle proof requires: Eavesdropping catch (Perception 16) **and** bottle capture or warded room setup.

---

## Non‑Champion Variation

If PC is **not** selected: shift to Investigation/Support lead. Encounters still run with perspective changes (E08 becomes coaching; tasks as spectator participation affecting Press/Professor trackers; graveyard access requires alternate flag chain).

---

## Epilogue & Seeding

Lock ending state across: Ministry stance, Order recruitment, Rival fates, Public narrative. Set three explicit “next‑year” hooks matching the chosen timeline branch.

---

### Author’s Implementation Notes

* Normalize numeric statlines in **NPC files** per the master formula unless marked as **Elite Override** for iconic figures (Dumbledore, Voldemort). Keep this main document free of raw stat blocks; link/mention the file names only.
* Every encounter’s last subsection includes **Exit** to keep the narration loop tight.
* All connections are explicit (`Connections:`) to make node‑based flow traceable during play.
