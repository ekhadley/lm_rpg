# Harry Potter Year 4: The Goblet of Fire — Campaign Plan

> **AI STORYTELLER EYES ONLY.** Keep all secrets, twists, mechanics, and backstage logic here; never reveal this document to the player. The world begins as canon and diverges based on choices.

---

## Hard Rules & Style Reminders (for running play)

* **Narration format:** All in‑universe narration is wrapped in `<narration>…</narration>`. No direct address to the player; always refer to the PC in **third person**. Never narrate the PC’s thoughts or actions that the player didn’t choose.
* **When to roll:** Roll when the outcome is uncertain, contested, or risky. Each roll is MP/MA/SG/PP + modifiers (+PM if proficient). Consequences should be meaningful.
* **Infosec:** Do not leak “big clues” without the right trigger and difficulty. Use red herrings and partials liberally; gate core revelations behind hard checks, earned access, or costly choices.
* **Combat:** Initiative when a fight is truly imminent; every combatant needs a sheet. Work mechanics into narration (MS costs, HP loss, reactions, etc.).

## Campaign Overview

### Opening Scene: Prose Recap (out-of-doc deliverable)

* **Purpose & placement:** Begin the campaign with a **1-page prose recap** of the summer and early fall, ending **as Harry arrives at King’s Cross with the Weasleys and Hermione** (about to pass through the barrier to Platform 9¾). This recap is **not included in this plan**; prepare it as a separate page for performance.
* **Length & delivery:** \~1 printed page. Deliver in play as a single `<narration>…</narration>` block. Third-person POV focused on Harry; no player address; no internal monologue beyond observable feelings (physiological tells, reflex thoughts implied by action).
* **Tone & style:** Grounded, cinematic, and slightly foreboding. Domestic warmth → public spectacle → night-terror unease. Keep language concrete and sensory; minimal adverbs; short beats that escalate. No meta commentary.
* **Must-include beats (PC-known facts only):**

  * Dursley summer baseline and sudden extraction by the Weasleys (Floo mishap allowed; keep brisk).
  * Invitation to and **journey toward the Quidditch World Cup**; tent-city wonder; mascots (Veela/leprechauns) as awe and distraction.
  * **Bagman’s cheer vs. Crouch Sr.’s stiffness**; Winky’s anxiety and proximity to Harry’s wand (do not reveal secrets—only what Harry plausibly sees).
  * **Death Eater riot**: masks, firelight, panic; separation and regrouping; wands out, few clear faces.
  * **The Dark Mark**: sky shock, Ministry chaos, accusations, Mr. Weasley’s controlled fear.
  * The hush of the **ride back** and quiet days at the Burrow; newspapers, whispers, and the way adults pause before finishing certain sentences.
  * Hermione arriving; friendly bickering; school letters packed; departure morning bustle.
  * Mr and Mrs Weasley's playful hints about a surprise waiting for them at Hogwarts.
* **Optional color (use sparingly):** smells of canvas and smoke at the Cup; the flicker of green on faces when the Mark blooms; Molly’s fussing over packed lunches; the clatter of trunks on the King’s Cross concourse; owl feathers stuck to a wool coat.
* **Foreshadowing (light):** Keep all foreshadowing **impressionistic**, not expository.
* **Transition to present:** Close on **the pillar to Platform 9¾**: Harry with the Weasleys and Hermione at a jogging start, breath held—then **cut** to the first in-school scene.
* **Constraints:** No spoilers beyond witnessed events. No big-clue leakage. Respect Year‑4 rules and narration format.

### Core Conspiracy (truth)

Barty Crouch Jr. (disguised as “Mad‑Eye” Moody) engineers the entire year to deliver the champion (Harry or the PC) to Voldemort via a portkeyed Triwizard Cup. He steers preparations so the champion who touches the Cup is the one most likely to **survive** the graveyard.

### Primary Mystery Threads

* **Surface:** Who entered the PC into the Tournament and why?
* **Deeper:** Why are the tasks tuned for lethal, real‑world combat?
* **Hidden:** Why is the DADA professor fixated on unforgivables and battlefield pragmatics?

### Secondary Mysteries

* Rita Skeeter’s impossible scoops; Crouch Sr.’s breakdown; Karkaroff’s fear; Winky’s secret; Bagman’s debts; Snape’s behavior; Dumbledore’s constraints.

### Themes

**Masks & deception; international pageantry vs. nationalist tension; media as weapon; innocence shattered; choice under pressure.**

## Opening Scene — Prose Recap Guide (Do NOT include prose in plan)

* **Deliverable:** A single, \~1 printed page recap (\~500–650 words) written in flowing **prose**, not bullet points. Keep it out of this plan; store separately.
* **POV & Style:** Close third‑person on **Harry**; free‑indirect narration allowed. Past tense. No meta or player address. Keep diction British‑leaning and book‑faithful; wry humor allowed but restrained.
* **Tone arc:** Warm → wondrous → uneasy → foreboding. Let spectacle sharpen into menace. Emphasize **masks & deception**.
* **Sensory motifs to weave:** soot & ash of the Floo; the Burrow’s cluttered warmth; parchment/ink smell of the Prophet; stadium thunder and emerald sparks; the hush after the riot; cool dawn air at King’s Cross; owl‑feather tickle; steam hiss; suitcase rattle.
* **Beats to cover (in brief vignettes, 2–5 sentences each):**

  1. **Summer at Privet Drive** felt smaller than last year; bad dreams and a fresh **scar twinge** after a nightmare he can’t quite shake; letter sent to **Sirius** about it.
  2. **Weasleys pick‑up via Floo** at the Dursleys; fireplace mishap; **Ton‑Tongue Toffee** incident with Dudley; Mrs. Weasley’s fury; Mr. Weasley’s awkward apologies.
  3. **The Burrow** as safe harbor: chaos, kindness, and a sense of normal that can’t quite hold.
  4. **Portkey to the Quidditch World Cup** with **Amos & Cedric Diggory**; stretch the moment of arrival and stadium wonder; mention mascots in impressionistic strokes (no long detours).
  5. **The match**: Ireland victorious, **Krum** snatches the Snitch; fireworks; joy.
  6. **Night riot & the Dark Mark**: confusion, masks, green skull—keep it impressionistic and frightening; **Winky**’s panic hinted; **Mr. Crouch** seen as brittle and officious.
  7. **Aftermath**: Ministry denial and bluster; Prophet headlines; new security rumors; Harry’s scar aches again in quiet.
  8. **Diagon Alley errands** & travel prep: a sense of costs and choices; glimpses of foreign students in London are fine as rumor only.
  9. **Present moment**: **arriving at King’s Cross with the Weasleys and Hermione**—crowded concourse, steam, Mrs. Weasley’s last checks, Crookshanks in carrier; end on them making for the barrier to **Platform Nine and Three‑Quarters**.
* **What NOT to reveal:** No explicit identification of Moody as Barty; no hard conclusions about Death Eaters at the World Cup; no Triwizard confirmation—keep it as **rumor/whispers**.
* **Hooks to seed:**

  * Harry’s **scar pain** as a private worry (Sirius thread).
  * Ministry obfuscation versus truth; tension around masked figures.
  * A clipped Prophet line about an **old tournament** possibly returning.
* **Cadence & structure:** Start late in each vignette; avoid exhaustive detail; vary sentence length; paragraph breaks every 3–5 sentences; close with a short, breath‑holding line before the barrier.
* **Continuity knobs:** If running a **non‑champion** branch, keep all beats identical; the recap remains neutral about selection.

  9–10 **Anti‑Gravity Mist** (PP save 16 or inverted).
  11–12 **Sphinx Riddle** (MA 20 or fight).
  13–14 **Imperius Trap** (MP save 18; attack nearest).
  15–16 **Dementor (or Boggart)** (Patronus or flee; MS drain).
  17–18 **Champion Encounter** (ally, duel, or betrayal).
  19–20 **Clear Path** (real or bait).
* **Outcomes:** Help rivals, race for cup, collaboration choice.
* **Consequences:** Alliances tested; injuries; cup touch triggers E18.

### E18 — The Graveyard & Return (Forced\*)

* **Trigger:** Cup contact; violent portkey to Little Hangleton.
* **Stakes:** Survival; witnessing (or stopping) resurrection; escape.
* **Phases:** Bind/ritual (10 min), rise of Voldemort, Death Eater roll‑call, duel/escape options.
* **Checks:** Multiple MP/MA/PP saves; SG 22+ deception for faux allegiance; Accio Cup MA 20; Priori Incantatem if brother‑wand.
* **Outcomes:**

  * **Survival → return:** Public disbelief; “Moody” tries to isolate PC; exposure sequence to follow.
  * **Disruption:** Prevent resurrection (alt timeline).
  * **Failure:** Capture/escape branch with heavy scars.
* **Consequences:** Year 5 setup sliders: Ministry denial vs. acceptance; Order activation; public opinion; enemy target status.

## Tournament Tasks: Scoring & Variants

* **First Task:** Scored on **style**, **speed**, **injury avoidance** (0–10). Provide compensators if PC is **not** a champion (e.g., clandestine help, spectator crises, black‑market interference scenes).
* **Second Task:** Score by **rescue time** and **moral choices** (adhering to one‑hostage rule or defiance).
* **Third Task:** Weighted toward **survival** and **ally support**; the cup is not always the “best” choice.

---

## Living World Rhythms & Timed World Events

* **Daily:** Breakfast news pulse → classes → library rush → clubs/detentions → curfew/patrols.
* **Weekly:** Dueling club (Tue), study groups (Thu), Hogsmeade select weekends.
* **Timed world events (examples):** Ministry inspection; Rita exposé; Karkaroff panic spike; Twins’ betting scandal. These **fire regardless** of PC attention and move clocks forward.

---

## Consequences & Trackers

* **Reputation:** House standing, press coverage, international view, staff trust.
* **Moody Suspicion (0–10):** No suspicion → confrontation‑ready. Increase via flask timing, behavioral tells, trunk rumors, Crouch testimony.
* **Permanent Changes:** Scars, disabilities, magical alterations, trauma tags (fear/cold resist), learned spells and resistances.

---

## Non‑Champion Flex Notes

If the PC is **not** selected: pivot to **investigation/support** arcs. Offer 1–2 bespoke routes to the graveyard climax (e.g., tracking portkey magic, following a taken champion, being seized as a hostage proxy). Keep school life rich: exams, detentions, research duels, journalism war with Rita, Karkaroff/Mark thread.

---

## Session 0 Run Sheet (one page)

* **Tone & Expectations:** Grounded canon; consequences real; failure changes the story, not ends it.
* **How play works:** Third‑person PC; `<narration>` tags; when we roll; what MS/HP look like in practice.
* **Lines & Veils (table safety):** Calibrate for torture descriptions, injuries, romance.
* **What failure means here:** Redirection, not soft reset; scars are story.

---

## GM Self‑Check Before & After Each Scene

* **Before:** What does the PC want? Which clock advances if time passes? Is this an encounter with pre‑set DCs? Are consequences clear? Do I need to roll?
* **After:** Did I honor hard style rules? Did I show consequences? Did I leak big clues prematurely? Is pacing tight (start late/end early)?

---

### Implementation Notes

* Cross‑link every encounter to the NPCs and locations above.
* Keep **DCs on the 5‑point grid** unless a specific spell tier dictates otherwise.
* Maintain the **MS economy** via rests, training costs, and stressors to create meaningful prep trade‑offs.
* Ensure **non‑verbal casting** difficulty is always applied when used.
* Keep the encounter catalog to **\~18 rich entries**; expand depth, not count.
