## Summer Recap (Pre-Game, Narrated in Opening Prose)
Harry spent most of the summer at Privet Drive, troubled by nightmares and a persistent scar twinge. He wrote to Sirius about the pain. The Weasleys extracted him via Floo (Ton-Tongue Toffee incident with Dudley). At the Burrow, life felt chaotic but safe. The family attended the Quidditch World Cup with the Diggorys via portkey. Ireland won; Krum caught the Snitch. That night, Death Eaters rioted and someone conjured the Dark Mark. Chaos ensued; Winky was found near Harry's wand; Mr. Crouch was brittle and officious. The Ministry denied and obfuscated. Rumors of an old tournament returning circulated in the Prophet. Harry's scar continued to ache.

## Session Events (Chronological)

### September 1st — Travel & Feast

**Platform 9¾ & Hogwarts Express:**
- Harry arrived at King's Cross with the Weasleys and Hermione. Passed through the barrier.
- Found a compartment with Ron, Hermione, and Neville Longbottom (who had a Mimbulus mimbletonia plant, rare, squirts defensive stinksap if prodded).
- **Malfoy visited the compartment** with Crabbe and Goyle. Made snide remarks about Ron's dress robes and hinted: "Enjoy the train ride. It might be the most relaxing part of your year." Harry got up and shut the door on him. Hermione noted the comment was oddly specific.
- Conversation about the mystery "event" at Hogwarts. Ron confirmed Percy (now working for Barty Crouch Sr. in Dept. of International Magical Cooperation) wouldn't reveal anything. Harry encouraged Ron to get in on Fred & George's plotting re: the Tournament.
- Mr. Weasley was observed exchanging a nod with an unrecognized hawk-faced witch on the platform, and his eyes swept the platform carefully before smiling (subtle security detail hint).

**Hogwarts Arrival & Sorting Feast:**
- Arrived in heavy rain. Carriages to castle (horseless as always — Harry doesn't see Thestrals yet).
- Peeves pelting water balloons; McGonagall silenced him with a look.
- Sorting happened (Harry clapped, forgot names).
- **Dumbledore's announcements:**
  - No Quidditch Cup this year (Harry felt his stomach drop; Fred looked devastated).
  - **Triwizard Tournament** announced: three schools (Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang), one champion each, three tasks, age restriction of 17, delegations arrive October, selection on Halloween.
  - DADA teacher delayed but arriving shortly.
  - Fred Weasley's "You're JOKING" outburst got laughs.
- Hermione provided Tournament history: established ~13th century, cancelled after 1792 (cockatrice rampage), death toll was the reason.
- **Moody's Arrival (E02 partially consumed):**
  - Doors banged open during feast. Moody entered: heavy cloak, gnarled staff, scarred face, one normal dark eye, one electric blue magical eye that spins independently, wooden leg (clunk on stone).
  - Dumbledore introduced him as new DADA professor. Sparse, uncertain applause.
  - Moody sat, pulled out a hip flask, drank. Blue eye roved the Hall. Fixed on Harry briefly.
  - Harry asked about him. Hermione reported: best Auror for ~20 years, fought in first war, lost leg on a raid, magical eye sees through walls/cloaks/etc.
  - Neville added "constant vigilance" — his gran's quote. Neville showed odd emotion when mentioning Death Eaters Moody put in Azkaban (hint at Neville's parents).
  - Snape was observed pointedly NOT looking at Moody; Moody's eye lingered on Snape.
  - **No E02 checks were triggered** (MA 15 for smooth navigation, MA 20 for flask cadence, SG 12 for bold intro). These opportunities should arise during first DADA class or corridor encounter.

**Common Room (Evening):**
- Gryffindor common room, password "Balderdash."
- Fred & George scheming by notice board; money changing hands with sixth-years. Ron went to talk to them, came back looking "thoughtful" and wouldn't say what about.
- Hermione predicted half the school would try to beat the age line.
- Harry hung around by the fire, went to bed. Slept well. Did not dream (contrast to summer nightmares).

### September 2nd — First Day of Classes

**Breakfast (E01 — Dark Horizons, Partially Triggered):**
- Owls delivered Prophet: **"DARK MARK CAUSES MINISTRY PANIC — SECURITY FAILURES AT WORLD CUP UNDER SCRUTINY"** — huge headline with looping photo of the Dark Mark. Sub-headlines: No Arrests Made, Fudge Deflects, Anonymous Sources.
- Hermione noted the articles never addressed WHO the masked wizards were — all procedural blame, no identities.
- Ron bitter: his dad was on the security team, came home "white as a sheet" after disciplinary meetings. Ron glanced at Slytherin table, noted Malfoy's satisfied expression.
- **Observed at Slytherin table:** Draco reading with a faint satisfied expression. Pansy Parkinson whispering to Blaise Zabini (no reaction from Blaise).
- **Staff table observations:** Snape speaking to Sinistra without looking at her, gaze fixed above students. **Moody absent from breakfast. Dumbledore's chair also empty.**
- **Hufflepuff first-year** near tears at the end of Gryffindor bench, staring at the Dark Mark photo. Harry did NOT interact with her. (SG 10 calm check from E01 not triggered; missed "Protector" reputation opportunity.)
- Harry gave Hagrid a thumbs up + watch tap + 4 fingers (visit at 4th period = Care of Magical Creatures).
- **E01 Outcomes:** Partial — Harry is aware of the Prophet narrative and Ministry blame, observed Draco's reaction and staff absences, but didn't engage with younger students or pursue deeper investigation. No perception checks rolled. Reputation track not significantly advanced.

**Herbology (Period 1):**
- Greenhouse Three with Professor Sprout.
- Squeezing Bubotuber pus into flasks (yellowish-green, smells like petrol, stings bare skin).
- Neville in his element. Ron splashed some on his sleeve, panicked for 20 minutes.

**Care of Magical Creatures (Period 2-3, with Hagrid):**
- Blast-Ended Skrewts introduced: pale, shell-less, legless, ~6 inches, smell of rotting fish. Some sting, some blast fire. No apparent mouths but can bite from unexpected places.
- Task: raise them, observe behavior, figure out what they eat (ant eggs, frog livers, grass snake offered).
- Malfoy's snide comment: "There might be a reason no one's reared them before." Hagrid's smile dimmed briefly.
- Harry got singed eyebrows. Lavender Brown burned on wrist. Dean Thomas discovered surprise biting.
- **Post-class chat with Hagrid:**
  - Harry shrugged about the Dursleys; Hagrid darkened ("Shoulda left yeh with a proper tail").
  - Hagrid nearly revealed something about the Tournament: "Yeh should *see* what they've got comin'—" then caught himself, mouth clamped shut. "Don' ask me nothin'."
  - Ron noted "He knows something." Hermione: "Hagrid always knows something."

**Currently heading to:** Double Divination after lunch.

## Encounter Tracker
- **E01 (Dark Horizons at Breakfast):** PARTIALLY TRIGGERED. Prophet headlines seen, some observations made. Key checks NOT rolled. Reputation not significantly shifted. Karkaroff not yet at school (arrives October). Could revisit staff-tension observations later.
- **E02 (The Scarred Auror's Arrival):** PARTIALLY CONSUMED at feast. Moody arrived, brief eye contact with Harry. Key interaction checks (MA 15 navigation smoothness, MA 20 flask cadence, SG 12 bold intro) NOT triggered. First DADA class should serve as the proper E02 interaction opportunity.
- **E03–E18:** Not yet triggered.

## Relationship/Reputation Notes
- Ron: Friendly, close. Involved with twins' scheming (secretive about it).
- Hermione: Friendly, close. Serving as primary info source (note: diversify exposition delivery).
- Neville: Friendly, sharing compartment/classes. Mimbulus mimbletonia owner.
- Hagrid: Warm. Nearly spilled Tournament secrets. Blast-Ended Skrewts project ongoing.
- Malfoy: Antagonistic. Train comment about "most relaxing part of your year" — oddly specific hint.
- Moody: Brief eye contact at feast. No direct interaction yet. Absent from breakfast Sep 2.
- Dumbledore: Absent from breakfast Sep 2. Brief eye-pause on Harry during Tournament announcement.
- Snape: Observed tension at feast (avoiding looking at Moody) and at breakfast (staring above students while talking to Sinistra).

## Open Threads / Player Awareness
- What is the Triwizard Tournament surprise? (Harry knows the basics from Dumbledore's announcement)
- Hagrid knows more about what's coming
- Fred & George scheming to beat the age line; Ron involved somehow
- Malfoy's cryptic train comment
- Prophet coverage of World Cup / Dark Mark — Ministry blame narrative
- Moody's magical eye, flask, and general mystique
- Harry's scar pain (summer) — wrote to Sirius, told not to worry
- No Quidditch this year (Harry disappointed)

## GM Notes
- Hermione has been the dominant exposition source across multiple scenes. Diversify: use Ron, Neville, overheard conversations, Prophet articles, professors, or environmental storytelling.
- E02 still needs proper resolution — first DADA class is the natural venue for Moody check opportunities.
- E01 could be revisited if Harry engages with upset younger students or investigates further, but the breakfast scene has passed. Effects: neutral reputation start.
- Pacing: Next immediate scene should be Divination or skip to something more interesting. Consider whether to montage through Divination (low-stakes, comic relief) or skip to a more engaging beat. First DADA class with Moody is the next major encounter opportunity.
- The player has been fairly passive/reactive so far — following the flow of school life. Encounters should start presenting more active choices and hooks soon.
