# **Harry Potter Year 4: The Goblet of Fire Campaign Plan (Final Revision)**
**AI STORYTELLER EYES ONLY** \- This document contains all spoilers, plot twists, and behind-the-scenes information for running a Goblet of Fire campaign. Never share these details with players. This campaign assumes the player is a fourth-year student at Hogwarts during Harry Potter's fourth year. The world begins exactly as canon but will diverge based on player choices.
## **Campaign Overview**
### **The Core Conspiracy Revealed**
**The Truth**: Barty Crouch Jr., believed dead in Azkaban, was smuggled out by his parents years ago. His dying mother took Polyjuice Potion to take his place, while he was kept under the Imperius Curse at home. When Voldemort discovered this through Bertha Jorkins, he freed Barty Jr. and together they:
1. Ambushed the real Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody at his home
2. Imprisoned Moody in his own magical trunk (kept alive for hair/memories)
3. Used Polyjuice Potion for Barty Jr. to impersonate him all year
4. Manipulated events to ensure Harry/player enters tournament
5. Planned each task to prepare the champion for graveyard survival
6. Turned the Cup into a Portkey to deliver them to Voldemort
### **Primary Mystery Threads**
* **Surface Level**: Who entered the player in the tournament and why?
* **Deeper Level**: Why do the tasks seem designed to be lethal?
* **Hidden Level**: Why is the Defense teacher preparing students for Dark Lord warfare?
* **Core Truth**: The entire tournament is a trap years in the making
### **Secondary Mysteries**
* **The Moody Inconsistencies**: Old friends notice personality changes
* **The Missing Official**: Where is Barty Crouch Sr. really?
* **The Terrified Headmaster**: Why is Karkaroff so frightened?
* **The House-Elf Secret**: What is Winky desperately hiding?

## **Story Architecture**
# **Opening Scene \- The Hogwarts Express**
**To be inserted at the top of the Story Architecture section in the campaign plan**
## **Campaign Opening: Shadows on the Express**
### **Initial Scene Setup**
* **Date**: September 1st, 11:00 AM
* **Location**: Platform 9¾, then Hogwarts Express
* **Atmosphere**: Tense excitement mixed with underlying fear
### **The Scene**
The scarlet steam engine of the Hogwarts Express belches smoke across Platform 9¾, but the usual excited chatter is subdued. Parents clutch their children a bit tighter, eyes darting nervously. Everyone's still talking about the Dark Mark at the World Cup \- some in whispers, others in arguments about what it means.
**Platform Observations** (passive, no rolls needed):
* Several Aurors patrol the platform (unusual)
* Mrs. Weasley hugs everyone twice, even those who aren't her children
* Draco Malfoy smirks knowingly while his father speaks in low tones
* A few families decided not to return this year (gaps in the usual crowd)
* Mad-Eye Moody's distinctive silhouette visible near the train (though player wouldn't know who he is yet)
**Initial Player Position**: The player has just passed through the barrier. Their trunk is loaded, they have their wand, and they need to find a compartment. The train leaves in 10 minutes.
### **Opening Choices**
The player must decide their initial approach:
1. **Find Your Usual Friends**
   * Seek out established relationships
   * Comfort in familiar company
   * Learn what others know about the World Cup
   * Miss other opportunities
2. **Investigate the Unusual**
   * Approach the Aurors with questions
   * Try to overhear Malfoy's conversation
   * Study the nervous parents
   * Risk missing good compartments
3. **Seek New Connections**
   * Find compartment with foreign students (early introduction)
   * Sit with different house members
   * Expand social circle before tournament
   * Potentially awkward interactions
4. **Find a Quiet Compartment**
   * Process World Cup events alone
   * Avoid initial drama
   * May encounter unexpected visitors later
   * Sets loner tone
### **On the Train (First Hour)**
Depending on choice, different encounters:
**If With Friends**:
* Discuss World Cup in detail
* Learn about different perspectives on Dark Mark
* Hermione has already read three articles about historical precedents
* Ron still shaken by attack on campground
* Perception DC 12: Notice someone eavesdropping
**If Investigating**:
* Auror (if approached): "Just a precaution. Nothing to worry about." (Obviously lying)
* Malfoy Conversation (Stealth DC 14 to overhear): "...Father says it's about time... weak leadership..."
* Nervous Parent (if comforting): Mentions rumors about "something big" happening this year
**If New Connections**:
* Meet Beauxbatons/Durmstrang students traveling early
* Learn about foreign magical education
* Gain potential ally for later
* Culture clash comedy/tension
**If Alone**:
* Time to process trauma/excitement
* Interrupted by candy trolley lady who seems nervous
* Later: Unexpected visitor (Neville looking for Trevor? Luna selling Quibblers? Draco looking for trouble?)
### **Arrival Approach**
As Hogsmeade Station approaches (late afternoon):
**Final Compartment Event** (varies by earlier choice):
* Friends: Hermione notices everyone's more worried than excited
* Investigation: Found disturbing clue about tournament
* New Connections: Foreign student mentions their school is "preparing for something"
* Alone: Overheard corridor conversation about "Dumbledore's risky decision"
**Environmental Details**:
* Thestrals visible to those who've seen death (minority of students)
* Extra security at Hogsmeade Station
* Hagrid calling first years seems forced cheerful
* Castle lights seem more welcoming than ever against gathering darkness
### **Transition to Castle**
The scene ends with carriages/boats heading to castle. Player's emotional state and information level depends on choices made. They might be:
* Informed but worried (investigation path)
* Supported but sheltered (friends path)
* Connected but confused (new relationships)
* Isolated but observant (alone path)
**Final moment**: As the castle comes into view, its many windows glowing warmly against the Scottish dusk, every student feels the same mixture of coming home and approaching danger. This year will be different. Everyone knows it, even if they don't know why.
**Lead directly into**: Sorting ceremony and Dumbledore's announcement of the Triwizard Tournament, where player spots the scarred stranger at the staff table who made them uneasy on the platform...
