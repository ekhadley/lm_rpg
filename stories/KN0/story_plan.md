## I. Campaign Overview

### Core Conflict
While the Triwizard Tournament captivates the school's attention, a darker plot unfolds in Hogwarts' shadows. Ancient protective wards are being systematically weakened by someone within the castle, creating vulnerabilities that Death Eaters plan to exploit when Voldemort returns. As a first-year with unique investigative skills and an outsider's perspective, Kathy becomes entangled in uncovering this conspiracy while navigating the already treacherous waters of her first year at Hogwarts.

### Central Mystery
**The Ward Breaker**: Someone at Hogwarts is using an ancient artifact called the Umbral Key to slowly dissolve the castle's protective enchantments. This person is leaving behind traces of dark magic that manifest as shadow creatures, cold spots, and areas where magic behaves unpredictably. The perpetrator is revealed to be Marina Blackwood, a seventh-year Ravenclaw prefect whose family has been secretly allied with Death Eaters for generations.

### Thematic Elements

## XI. Adaptive GMing Notes

### If Players Suspect Marina Early
- She increases charm offensive
- Creates false leads toward others
- May attempt to recruit them
- Accelerates timeline if necessary

### If Players Ignore Main Plot  
- Shadow creatures become unavoidable
- NPCs in danger require help
- Tournament events affected by shadows
- Personal stakes introduced

### If Players Are Too Successful
- Marina has contingencies
- Cassius becomes more active threat
- Additional Death Eater allies appear
- Ward damage accelerates

### If Players Struggle
- Moonwood provides more direct help
- Shadow Brigade members discover clues
- Dumbledore finally notices
- Marina makes mistakes from overconfidence

## XII. Conclusion Setup

The climax occurs during the Third Task chaos. Regardless of outcome:
- Voldemort returns (canon event)
- Cedric dies (canon event)  
- Castle wards are damaged but not destroyed
- Marina either escapes or is captured
- Shadow Brigade bonds are permanent
- Kathy has found her place at Hogwarts

The campaign ends with the leaving feast, where Dumbledore's speech about Voldemort's return has extra meaning for those who fought the shadows. The Shadow Brigade knows dark times are coming, but they've proven first-years can make a difference.

Seeds for potential sequel:
- Remaining ward weaknesses
- Marina's allies still at large
- Shadow realm connections
- Death Eaters know about the Brigade
- Umbridge year will be even darker
