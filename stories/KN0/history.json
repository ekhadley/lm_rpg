The scent of parchment and old leather fills the air as Kathy and Lyra huddle together at a quiet table, the sound of softly turning pages punctuating their urgent whispering.\n\nLyra, her usually neat braids coming loose around her face, pushes another heavy volume toward Kathy. \u201cListen\u2014these accounts all mention the \u2018Threshold Key\u2019 or \u2018Umbral Key,\u2019 and every single time, the attacks get worse until someone finds it or seals a breach. Some books even say the key isn\u2019t always a real key\u2014it can be a person, or something hidden in the castle itself. We still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s here, but... what if that\u2019s what the shadow is looking for?\u201d\n\nThe familiar background hum of the library is muted, as if the room itself is listening in.\n\nKathy glances at the annotated parchment where Lyra has jotted theories, connections, and citations from at least a dozen sources. \u201cShould we... go to Moody? Would he even believe us? He was so sure that corridor was dangerous. Or are we better off trying to research more on our own?\u201d\n\nOutside, the wind rattles the stained glass as Lyra\u2019s worry grows more intense. \u201cIf the key is somewhere in Hogwarts\u2014or worse, if someone is using it\u2014shouldn\u2019t the professors know? But if we sound like we\u2019re panicking, they might think it\u2019s just a first-year fancy.\u201d\n\nThere is a long pause before Lyra looks up, blue eyes catching the candlelight. \u201cWhat do you think, Kathy? Should we gather the group and take all our notes straight to Moody? Or keep digging until we have proof?\u201d\n\nLyra lets the silence stretch, hopeful and afraid, ready for Kathy\u2019s decision.</narration>"

But every one of these breaches started from the inside.\u201d She taps a finger on a line in an old, brittle book: \u201cLocal betrayal began the second shadow.\u201d\n\nA steely knot of anxiety settles in Lyra\u2019s expression. \u201cIf we go to Moody, and there really is someone\u2014a student, or even a professor\u2014doing this\u2026 what if they find out we\u2019re suspicious?

Lyra studies her for a moment, then nods, determination setting her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Moody\u2019s the only one who\u2019s treated this seriously, and he\u2019s definitely seen stranger things. If there\u2019s a traitor\u2014he\u2019ll know how to sniff them out better than we ever could.\u201d\n\nTogether, they hastily gather their notes and books, careful to tuck away the parchment with Lyra\u2019s annotated theories and records of the Umbral Key. The great clock in the library tolls the hour as the two girls slip past towering shelves and out into the corridor, avoiding Madam Pince\u2019s sharp eye as they go.\n\nThe castle feels different this evening\u2014corridors quieter than usual, the shadows pressed in close around the pools of lamplight. Every echo of footsteps behind them triggers a nervous glance, but no one follows. As they reach the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, the door is half-open and firelight flickers inside.\n\nMad-Eye Moody is there, one magical eye spinning in the candlelit gloom as he marks essays with heavy, slashing strokes. He looks up before they can knock. \u201cWhat are you two doing out after dark?\u201d he growls, but there\u2019s a keen readiness in his gaze\u2014a man expecting trouble at every turn.\n\nLyra hesitates, but Kathy steps forward, clutching the folder to her chest. \u201cProfessor Moody, we have something important. About the shadows. And the key.\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s good eye narrows, his magical one fixing on Kathy\u2019s face as if weighing invisible truths. He jerks his chin at a pair of battered chairs. \u201cSit. And you\u2019d better not be wasting my time\u2014night\u2019s when most spies do their work.\u201d\n\nThe door creaks shut behind them, shutting out the rest of Hogwarts.

Lyra found records from centuries ago at Durmstrang and Beauxbatons\u2014each time, there\u2019s mention of an artifact called the Umbral Key, or the Threshold Key. It protects something. When it goes missing, or someone inside the school tampers with it, that\u2019s when shadows first appear.\u201d She glances at Lyra for support, receiving a small, anxious nod.\n\n\u201cWe think the Key is here at Hogwarts right now,\u201d Kathy continues quietly, \u201cand someone\u2019s interfering with it. The cold places, the way magic goes wrong, people hearing things\u2026 all the signs match the old cases.\u201d She pushes a parchment forward, showing dates and cryptic notations from multiple sources. \u201cThese legends say if the Key\u2019s misused, it can destroy barriers\u2014the ones that keep those shadows out.\u201d\n\nMoody picks up the notes and scans them, magical eye whirring. He grunts, then taps the desk with a thick finger. \u201cSo you think one of your own is the culprit? Or a teacher?\u201d\n\nKathy swallows. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who. But the attacks started from the inside, every single time, and the shadow in the corridor whispered about a \u2018key\u2019 and about being locked out. It\u2019s looking for something\u2014or someone\u2019s using it for them.\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s scarred face is hard to read, but there\u2019s the faintest twitch of a smile in the craggy lines around his mouth\u2014approval, maybe, or respect for stubbornness.\n\n\u201cDark wizards love cracks and secrets, Nightingale. Good instincts. But you\u2019re right: there\u2019s a traitor, I\u2019ll ferret them out. The Headmaster\u2019s\u2026 got bigger concerns, for now.\u201d He leans close, lowering his voice. \u201cYou see anything odd\u2014a student out at night, a professor who can\u2019t account for their time, places colder\u2019n they should be\u2014you come straight to me. You understand?\u201d\n\nHe fixes Kathy and Lyra both with a stare and waits for confirmation. \u201cNever trust someone just because they wear the right robes. That\u2019s how schools fall.\u201d\n\nMoody sits back, flicking through their notes again, half to himself. \u201cUmbral Key\u2026 Haven\u2019t heard that name in years. Good work. Don\u2019t stick your noses in too deep, but keep those sharp eyes open. And tell no one else. If there\u2019s a leak in the castle, we might be all that stands between Hogwarts and the dark.\u201d\n\nA sharp knock rattles the door\u2014someone else in the corridor. Moody\u2019s wand is in his hand in an instant, signals for silence.\n\nWhat does Kathy do?</narration>"

Not if you want to keep your skin and your secrets.\u201d He motions the girls to the shadowy space between two battered filing cabinets just beside his desk, out of direct line of sight from the door.\n\nLyra scrambles to gather their parchments and slides behind the cabinet, her eyes wide. Kathy follows, heart pounding, careful not to rustle her robes as Moody stands and calls out with gruff authority, \u201cBusy. Can\u2019t you read? Come back at a proper hour.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a pause\u2014and then the unmistakable, silky voice of a student. \u201cSorry, Professor. I only need a moment. Filch said you found something in the corridor and\u2014well, I wondered if I could help.\u201d Someone steps into the doorway\u2014Kathy glimpses a mane of dark hair and the flash of a Ravenclaw tie.\n\nMarina Blackwood.\n\nMoody\u2019s tone turns to polite suspicion. \u201cEvening patrols aren\u2019t for first-years, Prefect Blackwood. Unless you\u2019re planning to tell me what you were really doing on the third floor last night?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a soft chuckle. \u201cOur house had noise complaints, Professor. I was just checking that no one was causing trouble.\u201d Marina\u2019s outline leans casually on the doorframe, the lamplight casting an angular shadow.\n\nMoody stands between her and the rest of the room. \u201cIf I see even a whisper of shadow in Ravenclaw Tower, you\u2019ll be the first to hear of it. As for the corridor, that\u2019s staff business.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a brief silence, then a smile in Marina\u2019s voice. \u201cOf course.

Only when the corridor is empty does Moody let out a low growl and wave the girls from hiding. \u201cThere\u2019s your danger, Nightingale. That one\u2019s a snake in eagle\u2019s feathers if ever I saw one. You two\u2014get to bed, and you didn\u2019t see me tonight. You come straight back if you hear anything else.

Today\u2019s classes are a patchwork of the ordinary and the magical: Charms in the morning, a double Herbology period after, History of Magic just before lunch, and a free period at the end of the day for studying or rest. The promise of actual lessons\u2014something solid and predictable\u2014brings a comforting sense of normalcy after the unease of the night before.\n\nBy the time Professor Flitwick appears at the Head Table, bustling with enthusiasm for first-year Charms, Kathy finds herself settling into the rhythm of a Hogwarts day: bag slung over her shoulder, wand safely inside, Archimedes perched in the owlery waiting for a letter home, worries temporarily folded away beneath the surface. For now, there are spells to learn, plants to repot, history dates to memorize\u2014the magic of daily life returning, for a little while at least.\n\nIf she keeps her eyes and ears open, maybe Kathy will spot another piece of the puzzle between incantations or between the rows of mandrake pots in the greenhouse.

Following Sprout\u2019s careful instructions, Kathy gently nudges the tendrils with her wand, watching how they respond\u2014a fascinating blend of caution and curiosity. When a vine shoots up the glove toward her wrist, she calmly casts *Lumos*; the plant recoils, shrinking down as though embarrassed.\n\nSprout beams at them both. \u201cExcellent! Controlled, but not afraid. Just the sort of touch Hufflepuffs are known for.\u201d She scribbles a note on her parchment. \u201cTen points for steady nerves, I think.\u201d\n\nEmmett\u2019s mouth quirks upward, pride shining through his dirt-smudged cheeks. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d be grateful for so much practice with basic spells,\u201d he whispers.\n\nWhen the class ends, Kathy feels a soft glow of achievement beneath a layer of earthy grime. The sense of normalcy\u2014of plants and soil and gentle encouragement\u2014settles her nerves and even makes the threat of shadowy magic seem a distant worry for just a little while.\n\nAs the first-years drift toward the castle for History of Magic, Marcus quietly falls into step beside Kathy in the corridor. His expression gives nothing away. \u201cLyra said you met with Moody. Did he believe us?\u201d he mutters, glancing sidelong to see if anyone is listening.\n\nThere\u2019s a pause, as a group of chattering Ravenclaw girls sweeps by. Only then does Marcus let his wariness slip. \u201cWhatever\u2019s going on, I\u2019m in. Just say if you need me.\u201d\n\nHistory of Magic beckons, and then\u2014at last\u2014lunch.\n\nDoes Kathy share anything more with Marcus along the way, or keep things quiet until the whole group is together next?</narration>"

He didn\u2019t just believe us\u2014he said we\u2019re right to be suspicious, and that something is definitely happening from inside the castle.\u201d \n\nShe glances over her shoulder to be sure no one is eavesdropping, then adds, \u201cHe told us to report anything strange straight to him, and not to trust anyone just for wearing the right robes. He really meant it. He even\u2014\u201d She hesitates, remembering Moody\u2019s warning about Marina. \u201c\u2014hinted there are people who look like they\u2019re helping, but aren\u2019t. He was especially wary of some upper-years.\u201d\n\nMarcus digests this, his eyes narrowed with a maturity that feels out of place on an eleven-year-old\u2019s face. He nods, lips pressed white. \u201cPrefect Blackwood\u2019s been everywhere lately,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cAlways in the right place to overhear, but she never answers questions about herself. You think it\u2019s her?\u201d\n\nKathy shrugs, feeling the weight of uncertainty. \u201cMoody didn\u2019t name names,\u201d she murmurs, \u201cbut he made it clear we should be careful around people who are too helpful, or too interested in what we know.\u201d\n\nThey slip into the stone-cold classroom, settling at desks as Professor Binns\u2019s monotone ghostly droning begins to fill the air.\n\nMarcus leans in one more time, voice barely audible above the shuffling of quills and parchment. \u201cIf you see anything, tell me\u2014even if you think it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Beneath his blunt manner there\u2019s a hard kernel of loyalty, his worry for the group clear in his gaze.\n\nThe old ghosts of Hogwarts\u2019 history seep from the walls, but for once, Professor Binns\u2019s recitation of goblin rebellions cannot smother the low thrum of something secret, vital, and very much alive in the shadows just beyond their little circle.\n\nBy lunch, the four friends are together again in the Great Hall, reunited with Lyra and Emmett, the secrets and uncertainties dividing them from the happy babble of oblivious classmates.\n\nDoes Kathy want to plan any particular action for the free period after lunch, or simply enjoy a rare moment of peace with her friends for now?</narration>"

By the time the last bells ring to signal the end of classes, the light has turned golden through the castle\u2019s westward windows and the buzz of tournament speculation crackles in the corridors.\n\nDuring her free period, Kathy manages to escape to the library with Lyra\u2014ostensibly for homework, but with a shared purpose. They pour over records of Hogwarts\u2019 architecture, looking for any mention of \u201cwardstones,\u201d hoping to match Lyra\u2019s discoveries about the breaches and the Umbral Key to a real location. Though nothing leaps out, Madam Pince eyes them suspiciously as they linger in the ancient stacks, and Lyra notes with quiet distress that several potentially useful volumes have recently gone missing.\n\nAs dusk settles, the Shadow Brigade regroups in a corner of the Hufflepuff common room: Kathy, Emmett, Lyra, and Marcus. They quietly compare notes, resolve their commitment to one another, and\u2014beneath their everyday chatter\u2014settle on a plan: tonight, they\u2019ll try to quietly observe the corridors where the last shadow attack occurred, hoping for a pattern, a clue, or at the very least to catch whoever might be tampering with the wards. Emmett, in particular, seems determined not to be left behind.\n\nEvening rolls forward, steadily carrying the comfort of familiarity. Dinner is lively, with Cedric Diggory good-naturedly fending off Hufflepuff underclassmen eager for tournament gossip. In the hallway afterward, Marina Blackwood pauses to flash Kathy a keen, unreadable smile\u2014but, perhaps aware of Moody\u2019s suspicions, she lingers only a moment before moving on.\n\nWhen curfew falls and the common rooms quiet, Kathy finds herself at the crossroads between caution and curiosity. With Lyra\u2019s map of the lower corridors in hand and Marcus promising to cover their tracks, the Shadow Brigade prepares for a first foray into the nocturnal castle.\n\n**[E04: The Midnight Patrol \u2014 Initiated]**\n\nMoving quietly through hush and shadow, following the hush of faded torchlight, Kathy\u2019s sharp ears pick up the low, tense sound of voices around the corner. Peering cautiously, she sees Emmett\u2014caught by the caretaker, Mr. Filch, who clutches a battered lantern and looks particularly vindictive.\n\nWhat does Kathy do\u2014try to help Emmett, hide, or risk revealing herself to Filch for the sake of her friend?</narration>"

For an hour, the only sounds are the scratching of quills and the low hum of Anya, a third-year, whispering to her pet rat in the corner. The ordinary work is oddly soothing: copying wand movements, labeling diagrams of Devil\u2019s Snare, reviewing the day\u2019s notes about goblin rebellions (even if Professor Binns\u2019s lecture is already blurring at the edges of memory).\n\nBefore long, sleepy exhaustion wins out. Homework finished and books packed away, Kathy says a soft goodnight to Emmett and climbs to her dormitory. Archimedes, alert-eyed, hoots a greeting as she slips beneath her quilt. Sleep comes quickly, the day\u2019s worries replaced at last by dreams of sunlight, laughter, and shadows that cannot cross the threshold of her bed.\n\nThe next morning dawns misty and fresh, the scents of earth and dew drifting through the magical windows. As Kathy dresses and descends for breakfast, she finds Lyra already at their usual spot, parchment open and theories scribbled around a half-eaten scone. Marcus joins a moment later, face tired but determined; Emmett, chipper again, calls out a cheerful good morning as he slides into his seat.\n\nThroughout the hall, the mood is brisk\u2014students abuzz with tournament rumors and the promise of the weekend.

Moody believes them, warns them not to trust anyone based solely on House or appearance, and specifically expresses suspicion toward Prefect Marina Blackwood (Ravenclaw). He instructs Kathy and Lyra to report anything further but tell no others.\n- During this private meeting, Marina interrupts, attempting to learn what Moody knows. Kathy and Lyra hide successfully. Moody clearly identifies Marina as a likely threat once she leaves.\n- That night, Kathy reassures Lyra and heads to bed, feeling slightly safer knowing Moody is now involved.\n- The next day, Kathy meets Emmett at breakfast and fills him in briefly; Marcus is also looped in, and is determined to help. The Shadow Brigade's bond deepens.\n- In lessons, Flitwick teaches 'Alohomora.' Kathy performs excellently, noting increased watchfulness from Flitwick. In Herbology, she and Emmett safely handle Devil's Snare, earning praise from Professor Sprout and House points.\n- At lunch, Marcus confides suspicions about upper-year students, especially Blackwood. Kathy shares Moody\u2019s warnings and affirms they must all remain vigilant.\n- The group later plans to scout the scene of the last shadow attack at night. During this unofficial patrol, Kathy rushes over to intervene when Emmett is caught out of bed by Filch. She successfully fools Filch with a quick lie about Emmett's sleepwalking, and both narrowly avoid detention.\n- The friends return safely to the Hufflepuff common room and spend the remainder of the evening on homework. Kathy feels the group is stronger than ever.\n- The night passes peacefully and the next morning brings clear skies. The Shadow Brigade regroups at breakfast, ready for whatever the new day brings.

And the way she was talking to those other prefects this morning\u2026\u201d Lyra hesitates. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about helping anyone. It felt like she was\u2026 organizing something. Or maybe warning them.\u201d\n\nShe shakes her head. \u201cI can\u2019t prove anything, but Moody\u2019s right. She notices more than most professors do, and she\u2019s much better at hiding it.\u201d\n\nEmmett and Marcus join as they near the stairwell, Emmett whispering, \u201cIs she watching us now?\u201d Marcus, always blunt, just mutters, \u201cIf she is\u2014let her. I\u2019d love to see her explain why.\u201d\n\nAs they climb toward their lesson, the group is more attuned than ever to the possibility that beneath Marina Blackwood\u2019s perfect badge and easy laugh, something very dangerous just might be at work.\n\nThe day stretches on, the knowledge of danger settling like a cool shadow over the light of every ordinary hour.\n\n</narration>"

She helps Emmett master the wrist movement for \u201cAlohomora,\u201d and together they earn Professor Flitwick\u2019s praise. There\u2019s no sign of Marina Blackwood, and for the duration of the lesson, the threat she represents seems distant and containable.\n\nAfter class, Kathy, Lyra, and Marcus split off for their scheduled activities, agreeing to regroup later in the library for an official \u201cShadow Brigade\u201d meeting. The hours pass with the mundane comfort of magical schooling\u2014lively discussions in History of Magic, the earthy patience of tending to puffapods in Herbology, whispered exchanges about spells and wardstones written on scraps passed back and forth.\n\nThe library reunion brings their disparate threads together. Lyra pulls a thick folio of notes from her bag, pointing to records of \u201cunexplained ward fluctuations\u201d dating back to the 19th century. Marcus contributes a list of hallways where the air turns unnaturally cold\u2014his own observations matching stories from the upper-year Slytherins. Emmett, meanwhile, brings word of a Gryffindor who swears they saw a shimmer, like heat off stone, slither down a corridor outside the Charms classroom.\n\nKathy catalogs each detail, watching her friends: they are animated, determined, a protective unit built not on hope but shared necessity. No one dares breathe Marina\u2019s name above a whisper, but now, suspicion has a focus, and the first-year Shield is held high.\n\nLate that evening, the Brigade disperses with promises\u2014report any shadow activity at once, meet again before the week is out, keep both eyes open and their trust only within this tight circle. Kathy retires to Hufflepuff, her mind sharper than her exhaustion. This time, as night settles, she feels no vague threat\u2014just the certainty of friends, allies, and a plan.</narration>"

Hushed speculation pulses along every table, and Prefects are suddenly more visible, shepherding students in pairs, their gazes sharper than before.\n\nAt breakfast, Lyra slides into her seat next to Kathy, eyes bright with news. \u201cThe attack was only a few corridors from where we saw the last shadow,\u201d she whispers. \u201cProfessor Flitwick\u2019s sealed off the area. There\u2019s word he was casting spells no one even recognized\u2014warding charms, I think.\u201d\n\nMarcus, striding over from the Slytherin table, murmurs, \u201cSlytherins are saying Blackwood\u2019s been down there. Pretending to help, but she had a weird look on her face when she came out. Half the house is nervous now, not that anyone will say that out loud.\u201d\n\nEmmett frowns. \u201cThat\u2019s the third attack this month. Moody was right\u2014it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d\n\nBetween their classes, the Shadow Brigade picks up scraps of overheard conversation: mention of \u201ccold spots\u201d now cropping up in the library, some magical torches refusing to light near ancient stones on the fourth floor, and Madam Pomfrey running low on Pepperup and Calmantia potions.\n\nAt midday, Professor Sprout stops Kathy outside the greenhouse. She looks serious, earthy hands folded in front of her. \u201cStick with your friends, Miss Nightingale. There\u2019s a chill in the castle this term that\u2019s got nothing to do with the weather. If you see anything\u2014plants wilting strangely, a sudden blackout in a corridor\u2014come straight to me, all right?\u201d Sprout\u2019s concern is clear. \u201cAnd tell your friends: just because it\u2019s invisible doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s harmless.\u201d\n\nAfter lunch, the day\u2019s classes march onward. The tension, however, is undeniable\u2014everyone feels the shadow pressing in, no longer a private mystery for Kathy and her friends.\n\nBy nightfall, another meeting of the Shadow Brigade is planned. The group agrees\u2014tomorrow, they\u2019ll split up to quietly search for breach points and lingering signs of shadow magic, each taking a different corridor known for recent disturbances. Moody\u2019s advice rings silently in Kathy\u2019s ears: stay alert, trust no one too quickly, document everything.\n\nFor the first time since arriving at Hogwarts, Kathy senses that their investigation is no longer a step ahead of danger, but running right alongside it.</narration>"

You know her schedule\u2014she won\u2019t notice if you\u2019re in the library, or near the Ravenclaw common room. If she really is behind all this, or knows more than she admits, we need proof.

New banners appear draped over the House tables. Lessons are interrupted by the excited chatter of upcoming delegations. Every evening, Dumbledore and the Heads of House give warnings about safety and curfew; ever since the recent attacks, Prefects are stricter, but the shadowy cold lingers in forgotten corners.\n\nThe Shadow Brigade\u2019s efforts settle into a dedicated rhythm. Lyra shadows Marina, discreetly charting her odd patterns: long stretches spent near statues and unused hallways, hushed conversations with older Slytherins, an uncanny habit of appearing just outside Professor Sprout\u2019s office. Marcus quietly befriends a few Slytherin upper-years, learning that rumors of shadow \u201ctests\u201d are circulating\u2014chilling dares that all seem to end near old wardstones. Emmett scours the library for references to castle security, sometimes bringing back hints of old breaches and magical repairs, while Kathy organizes their findings and, at Moody\u2019s encouragement, brings coded updates to him after double Defense.\n\nThe days shorten and the foreign schools arrive. Beauxbatons students sweep elegantly through the hall. Durmstrang\u2019s jagged uniforms and sullen expressions draw stares. The Goblet of Fire is unveiled in the Great Hall, and excitement builds to a fever pitch\u2014even Cedric, usually grounded, admits he\u2019s tempted to enter.\n\nBut under the fanfare, the shadows grow bolder. Every week, another unexplained cold patch, another student found dazed or ill. Rumors of an \u201cUmbral Key\u201d begin spreading among the most curious. Each time, the faculty doubles patrols and stress mounts.\n\nAs Halloween night falls and every torch glows orange for the Feast, the castle brims with anticipation: tonight, the Champions are to be chosen.\n\n**[E03: The Concerned Prefect \u2014 Initiated]**\n\nAfter the Feast, on her way back to the Hufflepuff common room, Kathy feels a familiar chill. Suddenly, Marina Blackwood steps from an alcove into her path\u2014her prefect\u2019s badge gleaming, her smile as polished as ever.\n\n\u201cKathy, could I walk with you a moment?\u201d Her tone is pleasant, but her eyes are sharp with interest. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019ve heard you and your friends have been involved in some of the recent incidents.

Using house elves somehow - unlikely they'd cooperate\n7.

Blackwood's been playing a long game, and tonight's chaos gives her perfect cover.\"\n\nHe moves to a locked cabinet, withdrawing several small objects. \"Time to stop watching and start acting.\"</narration>",

This is a key moment where Moody, who has been their adult ally, needs to make a decision about how to handle the Marina Blackwood situation. Based on the story plan, Marina is indeed the Ward Breaker and the main antagonist, so Moody would be taking this seriously.\n\nLooking at the story plan, Moody should:\n1. Take their evidence seriously (which he's doing)\n2. Likely want to act on it\n3. But also be cautious about a direct confrontation without more proof\n4. Possibly give the students some way to help or protect themselves\n5. Set up for future encounters\n\nThe objects he's withdrawing from the locked cabinet could be protective items or communication devices. This is a good moment to show Moody's experience while also keeping the students involved in the story rather than having adults take over completely.",

His magical eye fixes on Kathy while his normal eye scans the group. \"First thing\u2014I'm going to find Blackwood and see what she's up to during all this Tournament madness. But I can't arrest a prefect on portrait testimony alone, not without catching her red-handed.\"\n\nHe taps one of the crystals with his wand, and it pulses with warm light. \"These are emergency beacons. If any of you see Blackwood doing something suspicious\u2014and I mean actively tampering with wardstones or carrying dark artifacts\u2014you crush one of these. I'll come running, and we'll have our proof.\"\n\n\"But Professor,\" Emmett begins nervously, \"what if she's really dangerous? What if she catches us watching?\"\n\nMoody's grin is sharp and humorless. \"She's already marked you, lad. Running won't help now. Your best defense is being useful to me and staying together.\" He hands each of them a crystal. \"These also work as distress signals if you're in real danger. Don't waste them on homework emergencies.\"\n\nHe moves to the window, peering out into the darkening grounds. \"Potter's selection has everyone scrambling. Perfect cover for someone who needs chaos to finish their work. I'm betting Blackwood makes her move tonight\u2014question is where.\"\n\nTurning back to them, his expression grows deadly serious. \"You four have done good work, but now it gets dangerous. Stay in groups, trust no one outside this room, and if you see shadows moving where they shouldn't...\" He taps his wand against his temple. \"Remember what drives them back.\"\n\n\"What about the other teachers?\" Lyra asks. \"Shouldn't they know?\"\n\nMoody's laugh is bitter. \"Half of them think these attacks are just student pranks gone wrong. The other half are too busy with Tournament security to listen. No\u2014this stays between us until we have that witch dead to rights.\"</narration>",
