Kathy wakes in the darkness\u2014her throat dry, a vague pressure in her chest, the echo of some half-remembered dream already slipping away. Archimedes is a quiet lump atop her trunk, feathers fluffed in sleep.\n\nThe dormitory is still. A clock ticks softly above the door. The hush is comforting, but after a few minutes, Kathy realizes the pressure is more than a dream\u2014her bladder demands attention. She slips from her narrow bed, toes finding the rug, careful not to wake Hannah or the others. Silent and slipper-footed, Kathy opens the dormitory door and steps out into the low-lit corridor beyond.\n\nThe passage leading to the nearest bathroom is familiar\u2014yellow tapestry catch the glow of a single enchanted lantern, casting elongated shadows along ancient sandstone. Yet tonight, as Kathy rounds the first corner, she feels an unexpected chill crawling up her arms, the sensation prickling beneath her nightshirt. The torches ahead flicker. Cold, unnatural darkness pools near the floor where two corridors meet\u2014a darkness that doesn\u2019t seem to belong.\n\nBeyond the gloom, she hears nothing but her own breathing. Yet in the deepest, shifting part of the shadow, something stirs\u2014a suggestion of movement where light should reach but does not. At the edge of hearing, whispers slip between the stones, syllables for which Kathy has no words.\n\nThe corridor yawns ahead, and the shadow thickens\u2014a patch of night full of wrongness and cold. Something is watching from within, and every instinct says: run, hide, fight, anything but step closer.\n\nWhat does Kathy do?</narration>"

The beam sputters, barely pushing a few inches into the darkness. The unnatural shadow seems to lean in, swallowing the light, not retreating as it should.\n\nWithin the gloom, a shape coalesces\u2014long and thin, almost human but missing features, made mostly of living darkness. It leans toward Kathy, its movements wrong, drifting on the edge of vision. The soft whispers become sharper, threading through her mind with words she can almost\u2014almost\u2014understand.\n\nBetween the pale wand-light and the all-swallowing shadow, Kathy stands transfixed. The corridor feels colder by the heartbeat, breath fogging in the air.\n\nThe shadow creature edges forward, tendrils of darkness unfurling between stones.\n\nDoes Kathy hold her ground, run, or try something else?</narration>"

The wand\u2019s light stutters again\u2014stronger than before, but still little more than a stubborn glow that fails to fully slice through the shadow\u2019s unnatural veil.\n\nFor an instant, the darkness recoils, revealing a pair of pale, empty holes where eyes should be. The creature cringes from the wavering wandlight, but then surges closer, a rasping hiss echoing in Kathy\u2019s ears\u2014as if the shadow resents even this small defiance.\n\nA chill touch edges up Kathy\u2019s arm, numbing her skin.

Its form flickers, as if both present and already halfway gone.\n\nThe air feels less cold\u2014though Kathy\u2019s arm is still numb from where the thing touched her, and the sense of wrongness lingers.

The castle is bright now, shafts of golden morning streaming through every sconce and window, but Kathy can\u2019t help noticing how shadows still pool in the corners, long and strange.\n\nThey reach the spot outside the dormitory entrance where the darkness had gathered. The stones here are cold beneath their slippers\u2014even colder than elsewhere, with a faint slickness of rime clinging to the mortar. There, clear as a footprint in snow, is a mark: a ragged, frost-etched patch a foot across, shaped as though something had grasped the stone and tried to pull itself further into this world.\n\nEmmett kneels and traces the edge of the mark, pulling his hand back with a sharp hiss at the chill. There\u2019s no ordinary explanation for it\u2014it\u2019s not leaking water, not a draft. It radiates cold despite the summer warmth lingering in the lower corridors.\n\nHe looks up, eyes wide, voice nearly breathless. \u201cThis is\u2026 this is impossible, right? Should we get Lyra to take a look? I mean, she\u2019d know if this was some weird magical effect, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nFar down the hallway, the sounds of other Hufflepuffs stir as breakfast approaches, but here, for a moment, Kathy and Emmett stand alone with evidence the night\u2019s events were real.\n\nDoes Kathy want to fetch Lyra, try an investigation herself, or do something else?</narration>"

The clatter and bustle is almost overwhelming this early\u2014clashing cutlery, chattering voices, the rustle of owls swooping in with the post. Kathy and Emmett spot Lyra already at the Ravenclaw table, a heavy textbook propped against her goblet, lips moving as she reads just ahead of the day\u2019s lessons.\n\nKathy maneuvers through the crowded aisle, catching Lyra\u2019s eye with a small wave and a serious look. Without hesitation, Lyra closes her book, reads the urgency in Kathy\u2019s expression, and, after a quick word of explanation to her Housemates, comes to join them at the end of the Hufflepuff table.\n\nAs Emmett loads toast onto his plate, Kathy quickly fills Lyra in on last night\u2019s encounter\u2014the unnatural shadow, the cold, the frost-scar, the voices whispering of lost keys and hunger. As she speaks, Lyra\u2019s analytical frown deepens, and she starts scribbling notes on the back of her schedule sheet.\n\nWhen Kathy finishes, Lyra offers a rapid counter-interpretation: \u201cIf it left a physical mark, that means it broke the boundary between\u2026 well, wherever it came from and here. \u2018Key\u2026 lost\u2026\u2019\u201d She taps her pencil against her teeth, already plotting out questions. \u201cI want to see the mark myself. And maybe check the library for references after Ancient Runes today. Can you draw what it looked like, Kathy?\u201d\n\nAcross the hall, Marcus catches sight of the group and starts making his way over, curiosity piqued.\n\nWith a plan forming, breakfast stretches ahead\u2014eggs and questions and the promise of another day in the shadow of something unknown.\n\nDoes Kathy draw the mark for Lyra right now, head to class first, or invite Marcus into the conversation?</narration>"

Lyra leans close, brow furrowed, analyzing each line, while Emmett describes the ice-cold sensation and the strange, haunting feel in the air.\n\nMarcus studies the sketch, a thoughtful frown on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not Peeves, and it\u2019s not anything I\u2019ve heard about from my brother.

The frost-marked patch of stone stands out: pale, jagged, a memory of something utterly wrong stitched into the warmth of Hogwarts.

The shadow\u2019s chill lingers at the edge of memory, but with Moody alert and her friends near, Kathy finds herself able to focus on the magic she came to Hogwarts to master.\n\nAs the afternoon sunlight fades to the golden haze of late day, Kathy realizes she\u2019s surrounded by warmth, hopeful voices, and the faint, comforting scent of bakery spells rising from the Hufflepuff corridors below.\n\nBut somewhere\u2014somewhere\u2014ice still clings to the stones, waiting for the night.\n\nWhere does Kathy go or what does she do when her lessons conclude for the day?</narration>"

They mention that if something called a \u2018threshold key\u2019 is broken or lost, the defenses become erratic.
