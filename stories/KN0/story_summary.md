- Archimedes and belongings settled; Kathy quickly feels at home.
- This is her second night at Hogwarts - story is at the correct night for possible supernatural encounters.

- As per campaign plan, E02: First Shadow Encounter is triggered on the second night at Hogwarts. This encounter occurs while Kathy is in the dormitory and needs the bathroom at night, leading her into a dark corridor where a shadow creature lurks.

## E02: First Shadow Encounter - In Progress
- **Location**: Dim corridor outside Hufflepuff dormitory, second night at Hogwarts
- **Trigger**: Kathy needed to use the bathroom at night, heard supernatural whispers, encountered shadow creature as per campaign plan
- **Actions**: Kathy attempted Lumos, but oppressive cold and fear foiled first and second attempts (both failed to cast effectively)
- On a third, more determined try, Kathy focuses while backing away from the encroaching shadow, wandlight finally flaring brighter
- **Shadow's reaction**: The shadow creature is repelled by the new light, revealing a faceless form with empty eyeholes
- **Kathy's MS**: Now 11/13 after multiple uses of Lumos
- **Threat still present**: Shadow lashes out as it tries to resist or escape the light
- Kathy fled back to the Hufflepuff dormitory after confronting the shadow creature, using Lumos as a ward. 
- She was visibly shaken but told Hannah Abbott she was fine, promising to talk in the morning.
- Kathy got back into bed, Archimedes settling protectively at her feet.
- She attempted to fall asleep, still feeling numbness in her arm and haunted by the shadow's cryptic words: "home... not home... cold... hungry... the key... lost..."
- The corridor is clear but the icy scar left by the shadow remains.
- After lessons, Kathy and Emmett spent the evening working on homework together in the Hufflepuff common room. The room was filled with warmth, light, and the quiet comfort of routine after the previous night's supernatural encounter. 
- Emmett and Kathy both practiced their "Lumos" charm quietly, with Emmett determinedly trying to improve in case of danger.
- As they finished their homework, Kathy steered the conversation toward the Triwizard Tournament. Together, they speculated about what kinds of challenges might await the champions: dragons, merfolk, magical riddles, complicated spells, and rumors of even more dangerous magical obstacles. Emmett admitted he was both excited and a bit scared, especially after Kathy's shadow encounter the night before.
- Both agreed that the Tournament could be thrilling to watch, but that they'd rather stay far from anything near as dangerous as some of the historical stories—though, given recent events, neither felt able to shake the feeling that Hogwarts itself was already becoming a place full of hidden challenges.
- The day after Daniel is attacked by the shadow and left with a cold-burn mark, Eloise Fairweather secures the scene and Kathy rushes to get Mad-Eye Moody.
- Moody immediately investigates the corridor, identifies 'shadow realm residue,' and takes charge, warning everyone to avoid the area and sending Daniel to Madam Pomfrey.
- Kathy visits Daniel in the Hospital Wing. He describes the attack—feeling cold, powerless to cry out, a massive shadow stretching on the wall, and the shadow whispering about 'home' and 'the key.' Daniel heard the same phrases as Kathy: the shadow seeks something and grows stronger with each attack. Kathy tells Daniel to always use *Lumos* and find safety if he sees a shadow again.
- Kathy reunites with Emmett and shares all the new details. The pair quickly gathers Lyra and Marcus at breakfast, and Kathy recounts everything: Daniel’s wounds, the shadows’ words, and Moody’s reaction. Together, the group agrees that the shadows are after something specific and resolve to stay united.
- At lunch, Kathy meets Lyra in the library. Lyra has researched shadow incursions and finds old records showing that when 'wardstones' are breached, cold and shadows follow, and an 'Umbral Key' or 'Threshold Key' is always mentioned as missing, lost, or broken. These incursions are purposeful—they seek the key, and books warn that if it is found, the barrier between worlds can fail.
- Kathy and Lyra are discussing whether to research deeper, seek out the key’s location, or confide in a trusted adult.
- Kathy suggests on organizing their evidence and taking their findings to Moody (and possibly Dumbledore) to ensure the threat is understood at the highest level.
## Story Progress - Continued

- After Moody's investigation of the shadow attack, Kathy and Lyra research the Umbral/Threshold Key in the library, finding that every major magical breach starts from the inside and is connected to this key. They theorize someone in Hogwarts is tampering with it.
- They decide to trust Mad-Eye Moody and bring their evidence and suspicions to him. Moody believes them, warns them not to trust anyone based solely on House or appearance, and specifically expresses suspicion toward Prefect Marina Blackwood (Ravenclaw). He instructs Kathy and Lyra to report anything further but tell no others.
- During this private meeting, Marina interrupts, attempting to learn what Moody knows. Kathy and Lyra hide successfully. Moody clearly identifies Marina as a likely threat once she leaves.
- That night, Kathy reassures Lyra and heads to bed, feeling slightly safer knowing Moody is now involved.
- The next day, Kathy meets Emmett at breakfast and fills him in briefly; Marcus is also looped in, and is determined to help. The Shadow Brigade's bond deepens.
- In lessons, Flitwick teaches 'Alohomora.' Kathy performs excellently, noting increased watchfulness from Flitwick. In Herbology, she and Emmett safely handle Devil's Snare, earning praise from Professor Sprout and House points.
- At lunch, Marcus confides suspicions about upper-year students, especially Blackwood. Kathy shares Moody’s warnings and affirms they must all remain vigilant.
- The group later plans to scout the scene of the last shadow attack at night. During this unofficial patrol, Kathy rushes over to intervene when Emmett is caught out of bed by Filch. She successfully fools Filch with a quick lie about Emmett's sleepwalking, and both narrowly avoid detention.
- The friends return safely to the Hufflepuff common room and spend the remainder of the evening on homework. Kathy feels the group is stronger than ever.
- The night passes peacefully and the next morning brings clear skies. The Shadow Brigade regroups at breakfast, ready for whatever the new day brings. The threat of the key and the traitor persists, with Moody now an ally and Marina Blackwood under suspicion.
