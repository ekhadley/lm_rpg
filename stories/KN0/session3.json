Her three friends watch in amazement as the light dances at the tip of her apple wood wand, casting gentle shadows that shift and play across their faces.\n\n\"Brilliant!\" Emmett breathes, his sandy hair catching the magical light. \"That's the most elegant *Lumos* I've seen anyone manage. When I tried it at home, mine kept flickering like a dying candle.\"\n\nLyra leans forward, studying the spell with obvious fascination. \"The stability is remarkable. According to Waffling's theory, maintaining consistent luminosity requires precise thaumic control...\" She catches herself mid-explanation and grins sheepishly. \"Sorry, I've been reading ahead again.\"\n\nMarcus nods approvingly from his corner of the compartment. \"My brother mentioned that first-year magic on the train usually ends badly.

My parents keep asking which one I want, but honestly, I don't know enough about any of them to have a preference.\"\n\nLyra adjusts her braids nervously. \"The Hat supposedly takes your choice into account, but what if you choose wrong? My parents were both Ravenclaws, and they keep talking about 'family tradition' and 'intellectual legacy.' But what if I'm not clever enough? What if I disappoint them?\"\n\nMarcus's expression darkens slightly. \"At least your parents want you in their House. Everyone expects me to end up in Slytherin because of my family name, but...\" He trails off, staring out the window. \"Sometimes I wonder if that's really where I belong, or if it's just where everyone thinks I should go.\"\n\nThe train rounds a bend, and somewhere down the corridor, they can hear older students laughing and the distinctive sound of Exploding Snap cards detonating.

Compartment doors slam open all along the train as students pour onto the platform, their voices mixing with the sound of trunks being dragged and owls hooting in protest at being jostled.\n\nKathy grabs Archimedes' travel cage while Emmett helps her wrestle her trunk from the overhead rack. The four friends join the stream of students flowing toward the exit, black robes swirling around them in the cool September evening air.\n\nHogsmeade Station is smaller than King's Cross but no less magical\u2014lanterns float without support above the platform, casting warm pools of light that dance across the crowd of students. The air smells of woodsmoke and autumn leaves, with an underlying hint of magic that makes the hair on Kathy's arms stand up.\n\n\"Firs' years! Firs' years over here!\" booms a voice that seems to shake the very platform. Through the crowd, they catch sight of an enormous man with wild hair and a tangled beard, holding a lantern aloft. He towers over the students around him like a gentle giant.\n\n\"That must be Hagrid,\" Lyra says, consulting her mental catalog of Hogwarts knowledge. \"The Keeper of Keys and Grounds. He's supposed to escort the first years.\"\n\nMarcus nods toward where older students are climbing into horseless carriages. \"The rest go up in the carriages. But first years...\" He gestures toward the lake, where several small boats bob gently at a wooden dock.\n\n\"Boats?\" Emmett asks, his voice climbing slightly. \"Nobody mentioned boats.\"\n\n\"Firs' years! Don' be shy now, come along!\" Hagrid calls again, his beetle-black eyes twinkling kindly as he spots the cluster of nervous first years. \"Leave yer trunks here, they'll be taken up ter the castle separately. Jus' bring what yeh need fer tonight!\"\n\nKathy exchanges glances with her three friends, then takes a deep breath and steps forward toward the giant man and the waiting boats, Archimedes' cage clutched firmly in her hands.\n</narration>"

Marcus climbs in with practiced ease, while Kathy brings up the rear, carefully placing Archimedes' cage on the floor between her feet.\n\n\"Right then,\" Hagrid booms once all the first years are seated. \"Everyone in? Forward!\"\n\nWithout any visible means of propulsion, the boats begin to glide smoothly across the dark water. The lake stretches before them like black glass, reflecting the first stars beginning to appear in the evening sky. Around them, the other boats drift in a loose flotilla, filled with nervous first years stealing glances at one another.\n\nAs they round a bend in the shoreline, Hogwarts Castle comes into full view across the water\u2014magnificent and imposing, its many towers reaching toward the sky, every window ablaze with warm golden light. The sight takes Kathy's breath away.\n\n\"Heads down!\" Hagrid calls from the lead boat as they approach what appears to be a curtain of ivy hanging from a cliff face.\n</narration>"

But it's the view behind them, back across the lake, that steals her breath completely.\n\nHogwarts Castle rises from its rocky perch like something from a fairy tale, its ancient stones warm with centuries of magic. Towers spiral impossibly high, their conical roofs sharp against the darkening sky. Gothic windows glow like jewels\u2014some flickering with candlelight, others steady with magical illumination. The Great Hall's massive windows cast long rectangles of golden light across the water, and she can just make out the shadows of figures moving within.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" Emmett whispers, his voice filled with wonder.\n\nLyra nods, for once speechless as she takes in the architectural marvel before them. \"The engineering alone... how do those towers even stay standing?\"\n\nMarcus, who had been trying to appear nonchalant, can't hide the awe in his expression. \"My brother described it, but... this is something else entirely.\"\n\nThe reflection of the castle wavers on the lake's surface, doubled and made ethereal by the gentle movement of the water. Other first years in nearby boats are equally mesmerized, their nervous chatter dying to reverent whispers.\n\nIn her cage, Archimedes shifts and gives a soft, appreciative hoot, as if he too recognizes that they've arrived somewhere extraordinary.\n\n\"Welcome ter Hogwarts,\" Hagrid calls softly from the lead boat, his voice carrying easily across the water. The pride and warmth in his tone suggest he never tires of seeing this moment\u2014the first glimpse of home through new eyes.\n\nThe boats begin to glide toward a set of stone steps carved into the cliff face, where warm light spills from an entrance that will lead them up into the castle itself.\n</narration>"

Emmett clutches his wand case protectively, eyes wide as he takes in their surroundings. Lyra has gone quiet, which somehow seems more significant than any amount of chatter.\n\nThe entrance ahead of them is a massive oak door, easily twice the height of a normal doorway, its iron hinges dark with age. Warm light spills from within, and they can hear the distant sound of hundreds of voices\u2014the rest of the school, already seated and waiting.\n\nOther first years cluster around them on the steps, some whispering nervously, others struck silent by the magnitude of the moment.

Her graying hair is pulled back in a tight bun, and her emerald robes are pristine despite the late hour. When she speaks, her voice carries easily through the hall, crisp and authoritative.\n\n\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" she begins, her Scottish accent lending gravity to the words. \"In a few moments you will join your classmates in the Great Hall for the Sorting Ceremony. Before you take your seats at your House tables, you must be sorted into your Houses.\"\n\nShe pauses, allowing the weight of this to settle over the nervous first years.\n\n\"The four Houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. While you are at Hogwarts, your House will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points, your rule-breaking will cost you points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points will win the House Cup.\"\n\nBehind the massive doors leading to the Great Hall, they can hear a low murmur of voices\u2014hundreds of students waiting. The sound makes Kathy's stomach flutter with nerves.\n\n\"The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily,\" Professor McGonagall continues. \"I suggest you use this time to smarten yourselves up as much as possible.\"\n\nHer gaze sweeps over the group, lingering on a boy whose tie is crooked and a girl whose hair has escaped its ponytail during the boat journey.\n\n\"I will return when we are ready for you.
