Several older Ravenclaw students look up curiously as Kathy takes a seat\u2014inter-house socializing at meals isn't unheard of, but it's not entirely common either.\n\n\"Find anything interesting?\" Kathy asks, nodding toward the books as she serves herself shepherd's pie.\n\n\"More than I expected,\" Lyra says grimly, keeping her voice low. \"Look at this.\" She slides a thick tome across the table\u2014*Modern Magical Education: Curriculum Standards 1980-1994*.\n\n\"The Defense Against the Dark Arts curriculum for first years hasn't included Unforgivable Curses since 1979,\" Lyra whispers. \"And that was during the height of the last war, when Voldemort was at his most powerful.\"\n\nEmmett arrives from the Hufflepuff table, looking around uncertainly before taking a seat. \"Is this allowed?\" he asks quietly.\n\n\"No rule against it,\" a second-year Ravenclaw says helpfully. \"Though it's unusual.\"\n\nMarcus approaches from the Slytherin table, and soon all four friends are clustered together at the Ravenclaw table, drawing some interested looks but no interference from the professors.\n\n\"So,\" Marcus says quietly, \"what did everyone make of our first day? Because that Defense lesson was...\"\n\n\"Completely mental,\" Emmett finishes.\n</narration>"

If someone with his experience thinks first-years need to know about Unforgivable Curses...\" He leaves the implication hanging.\n\nLyra flips through her research notes. \"I found something else troubling. Professor Moody wasn't supposed to start teaching until next week. The original Defense professor, Professor Whitmore, withdrew her application suddenly at the end of August. No explanation given.\"\n\n\"That's the third Defense professor in as many years,\" Emmett observes. \"My parents mentioned something about the position being... problematic.\"\n\nA older Ravenclaw student leans over. \"Sorry to interrupt, but you're talking about the Defense position? My sister graduated two years ago. She said there were rumors that it was cursed\u2014no professor has lasted more than a year since the early 1970s.\"\n\nThe friends exchange glances. Between cursed teaching positions, modified curricula, and ominous warnings about dark times, their first day at Hogwarts has been far from the magical education they'd anticipated.\n\n\"There's something else,\" Kathy says quietly, remembering her Sorting experience. \"The Hat mentioned something to me about 'shadows in the stones.'\"\n</narration>"

There are historical precedents.\" She pulls out another book from her stack\u2014*Hogwarts: A History*. \"The Sorting Hat has occasionally given cryptic warnings during periods of significant danger to the school.\"\n\nShe flips to a marked page. \"Here\u2014in 1943, it warned several students about 'ancient evils stirring in forgotten places.' That was the year the Chamber of Secrets was first opened. In 1976, it mentioned 'darkness gathering strength' to three different students. Voldemort was rising to power.\"\n\nMarcus leans forward, interested despite himself. \"So when the Hat gives warnings like that...\"\n\n\"It means the school is in genuine danger,\" Lyra finishes. \"But here's what's interesting\u2014it doesn't warn everyone. Only specific students, usually those it believes will be instrumental in addressing whatever threat is coming.\"\n\nEmmett looks troubled. \"So Kathy's warning about 'shadows in the stones'...\"\n\n\"Suggests something is wrong with Hogwarts itself,\" Lyra says, closing the book. \"The stones\u2014the very foundation and structure of the castle. If shadows are affecting them...\"\n\nShe trails off, but the implication is clear.

She'd come to Hogwarts hoping to learn magic and make friends\u2014not to confront whatever \"shadows in the stones\" might represent.\n\nMarcus breaks the silence first. \"My brother mentioned something odd last year,\" he says quietly. \"Cold spots in certain corridors, places where magic seemed... different somehow.

He glances around the hall, as if seeing it differently. \"If there's something wrong with the foundations, with the castle itself...\"\n\nLyra taps her fork against her plate thoughtfully. \"We should pay attention. All of us. Notice anything unusual, any patterns.\" She looks directly at Kathy. \"Especially you.
