Marcus stands near the \"Experienced Owls\" section, but his gaze has shifted to watch Kathy and Archimedes.\n\nThe owl continues his soft questioning call, and his head bobs slightly as if he's trying to communicate something specific.

There's no aggression in the movement\u2014instead, it's almost delicate, as if he's reading something in her scent that others might miss.\n\nArchimedes gives a soft, almost inaudible click of his beak, then does something that makes the feather-covered witch gasp audibly. He gently presses the side of his head against Kathy's palm, his ear tufts brushing against her fingers. The gesture is unmistakably affectionate\u2014a greeting reserved for trusted companions.\n\n\"Blimey,\" the shop witch breathes, her own tawny owl ruffling its feathers in apparent surprise. \"I've never seen him do that.

Emmett makes a joke about how his peppermint toad ice cream actually squeaked when he bit into it, and soon they're all laughing again, the dark topics forgotten in favor of speculation about whether the chocolate frogs in their new sweets will try to escape.\n\nAs they finish their ice cream, the late afternoon sun slants lower through the parlour windows, and parents begin gathering packages and owl cages with the practiced efficiency of a day well spent.\n\n\"We should probably head back,\" Kathy's mother suggests gently, approaching their table. \"It's been quite a day, and we still have the journey home ahead of us.\"\n\nThe four friends exchange addresses\u2014Emmett in Manchester, Lyra in London, Marcus in Yorkshire, and Kathy near Ottery St. Catchpole\u2014though they agree that owl post will be much more exciting than regular letters.\n\n\"King's Cross, September first,\" Lyra says with characteristic precision as they gather their belongings. \"Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at ten-thirty.\"\n\n\"I'll look for you all,\" Marcus adds, his usual guarded expression softened by the day's camaraderie.\n\n\"This is going to be brilliant,\" Emmett declares, carefully adjusting his owl cage. \"I can't wait to see Hogwarts.\"\n\nAs they part ways outside the ice cream parlour, each family heading toward the Leaky Cauldron and their respective journeys home, Kathy feels a warm glow of anticipation. The nervous excitement that had plagued her all summer has transformed into something purely joyful. She has friends now, and Archimedes, and a wand that feels like part of her own soul.\n\nHogwarts suddenly feels less like a daunting unknown and more like an adventure waiting to begin.\n</narration>"

Steam from the scarlet Hogwarts Express billows across Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that makes everything feel slightly unreal.\n\nKathy spots her friends almost immediately near the barrier entrance. Emmett is easy to recognize, his sandy hair catching the morning light as he struggles with an overpacked trunk. Lyra stands precisely beside her organized luggage, checking her pocket watch, while Marcus leans against a pillar with his more modest collection of belongings, looking remarkably calm amid the chaos.\n\n\"Kathy!\" Emmett calls out when he sees her approaching with her parents. \"Can you believe we're actually here?\"\n\nThe four friends converge like iron filings drawn to a magnet, their excitement palpable despite the two weeks that have passed since Diagon Alley. Archimedes hoots softly from his cage, seeming to recognize the other owls from their shopping expedition\u2014Marcus's dignified barn owl, Lyra's small but efficient screech owl, and Emmett's excitable little tawny.\n\n\"The train leaves in fifteen minutes,\" Lyra announces, though her usual precision is tempered by barely contained enthusiasm. \"We should find a compartment together.\"\n\nAround them, older students move with practiced ease, while other first-years look as wide-eyed and nervous as they feel. The massive steam engine ahead of them seems to promise adventure and transformation in equal measure.\n</narration>"
