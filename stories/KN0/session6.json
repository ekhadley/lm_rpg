            "content": "<narration>The candlelit Great Hall brims with laughter and the constant flutter of hundreds of owls swooping overhead, dropping letters and parcels to students up and down the four house tables. Kathy, her first day at Hogwarts complete but with her mind still racing, sits wedged between Emmett and Hannah Abbott; a tidy plate of shepherd\u2019s pie sits barely touched in front of her, the day\u2019s swirl of lessons leaving a low buzz in her head. Archimedes, his curious golden eyes alert, perches beside her plate, deeply engaged in a silent staring contest with a rotund, black-patched school owl who keeps nudging into his space.\n\nThe warm, earthy scents of bread, roasted vegetables, and treacle pudding drift upward, but conversation at the Hufflepuff table centers on the Triwizard Tournament\u2014even Cedric, usually calm and collected, looks half a year older as upper-years nudge him about entering when he turns seventeen in October. Eager questions swirl all around: What were the Unforgivable Curses really like to see in class? Will Beauxbatons bring their famed powder-blue carriages? Are Durmstrang students really masters of dark magic?\n\nAcross the hall, Kathy glimpses Lyra deep in animated conversation at the Ravenclaw table, gesturing with a bread roll as if sketching a ward on parchment. Marcus sits at the near end of the Slytherin table, only half-listening to his housemates, a smile flickering when he catches Kathy\u2019s eye. Dumbledore\u2019s silver beard gleams even from her distant vantage, his eyes twinkling as he surveys the hall, but there\u2019s a new alertness behind his half-moon spectacles.\n\nSomewhere beneath the surface, a sense of unfinished business tugs at Kathy\u2014a tension that lingers with the memory of shadows in the stones and the Sorting Hat\u2019s cryptic warning. For now, though, the castle pulses with noisy, mundane joy: professors chatting over their pudding, owls circling for scraps, the waxy glow of floating candles illuminating every hopeful face.\n\nAs the last letters drop between plates and the students\u2019 laughter rolls on, a perfect moment presents itself for Kathy to act\u2014to return the conversation to shadows, join a friend at another table, speak with Cedric, or simply lose herself in the safe, golden warmth of her new house. The night is still full of possibilities.</narration>"

            "content": "<narration>Kathy breathes in the mingled scents of roasted root vegetables and fresh bread, focusing on the simple comfort of the familiar meal in front of her. With a quiet determination that comes as much from exhaustion as intent, she lifts her fork and digs in, letting the savory warmth of shepherd\u2019s pie anchor her in the present. Each bite mutes the persistent edge of worry, blurring the memory of the Sorting Hat\u2019s strange warning until, for a moment, it feels far, far away\u2014something she can think about tomorrow.\n\nAround her, conversation turns lighthearted: Hannah speculates about which house will have the best common room snacks, Emmett confesses he\u2019s already lost track of where all the staircases go, and a second-year regales the table with the story of the time a jarvey snuck into the kitchens, leading to a dramatic chase and at least three expulsions (if you believe the tale). Archimedes, content now, nibbles a proffered bit of bacon, offering a satisfied hoot.\n\nSoon, dessert appears\u2014bowls of sticky toffee pudding, apple tart with clotted cream, the legendary Hufflepuff honey cakes\u2014drawing out delighted sounds from all sides. Conversation becomes a blur of laughter and teasing. Someone conjures tiny floating sunflower seeds to amuse the owls.\n\nFor a while, in the golden laughter and the honey-bright light, the shadow at the edge of Kathy\u2019s memory fades. The promise of belonging sits warm and real in her chest, and if the stones are restless beneath her feet, it is easier, just for tonight, to pretend it was a trick of nerves and the old hat\u2019s penchant for dramatics.\n\nThe feast begins to wind down. Dumbledore rises again, clapping once for attention, and McGonagall and the prefects move through the aisles with calls for first-years to line up. The hour is late; it\u2019s time to see the Hufflepuff common room for the first time, to claim a bed and a patch of Hogwarts belonging to her alone.\n\nWith a final forkful of pudding, Kathy stands, Archimedes hopping lightly onto her shoulder as the crowd surges toward the door, sunflowers and shadows both left behind for now.</narration>"

Each house\u2019s hourglass sparkles with gemstones\u2014emerald for Slytherin, sapphire for Ravenclaw, ruby for Gryffindor, and a warm, fluidy amber for Hufflepuff\u2014tallying the day\u2019s triumphs and slips.\n\nTonight, on the very first evening, all four hourglasses appear nearly identical, their gemstones glinting in the candlelight. If Hufflepuff\u2019s sand-and-honey gems seem just a bit more plentiful than the others, it\u2019s only by the barest margin\u2014perhaps a nod to collective good behavior, or simply the result of the Hat\u2019s annual muttering about loyalty and friendship during the feast. No points seem to have been lost or dramatically gained just yet (aside from a rare burst of rubies when a Gryffindor second-year helped a younger student find a lost wand at the table).\n\nA tentative murmur passes down the Hufflepuff line\u2014Hannah whispering that the hourglasses don\u2019t really begin to shift until the second day, when Professor Sprout \u2018remembers where she put the notes\u2019 and McGonagall starts her campaign of precision point deductions.\n\nFor tonight, Kathy\u2019s gaze lingers on the sunny glow of Hufflepuff\u2019s gems, marking the perfect balance of a new beginning. Tomorrow, the true competition\u2014and, with it, the first real risks and rewards\u2014will begin.</narration>"

Eloise Fairweather, fifth-year prefect with a broad smile and a reassuring presence, leads the way, weaving the new first-years through the castle\u2019s lower corridors with practiced patience.\n\nThe passage down to the Hufflepuff common room is cool and winding, lit by torches that give off a soft, golden glow. The further they descend, the warmer and more inviting the air becomes, tinged with the scents of baking bread, herbs, and earth after rain. Kathy feels the tension of the day slip from her shoulders, replaced by a gradually deepening curiosity about the space that will now be home.\n\nEloise stops before a stack of barrels set into a rounded stone wall, grinning as she demonstrates the entrance: a precise rhythm\u2014tap tap, pause, tap\u2014on the second barrel from the bottom. The lid slides aside, soft and silent, revealing a low, round passageway lined with glowing amber stones. One by one, the first-years duck through.\n\nBeyond, the Hufflepuff common room opens up into a sunken, circular lounge that radiates cozy magic. Overstuffed armchairs and sofas cluster around a broad hearth, where cheerful flames flicker. The walls are hung with tapestries of yellow and black, embroidered with historic House champions, fields of magical herbs, and a perpetually drifting artist\u2019s rendering of Helga Hufflepuff herself.\n\nPotted plants spill their leaves from stone sills and domed windows set just below the level of the castle\u2019s lawns; moonlight filters through the grass, dappling the honey-colored stone with cool silver. The whole place feels like a den\u2014safe, secret, tucked away from all troubles.\n\nSome of the older students linger nearby, but most first-years are too worn out to linger. Kathy finds her trunk already set at the foot of a small, canopied bed in the girls\u2019 dormitory, yellow coverlet tucked down and a little window showing the roots of a dandelion outside. Archimedes settles immediately onto the windowsill, giving the glass a cautious tap before fluffing himself into a ball.\n\nSlipping into her pajamas and sliding beneath the covers, Kathy feels exhaustion pull her down. The mattress is soft, the sheets cool and clean, the faintest scent of honey in the air. The last thing she hears is a gentle bit of owl-song and the low, sighing hum of the castle settling for the night.\n\nFor the first time, Hogwarts feels like home.</narration>"

Campaign Overview\n\n### Core Conflict\nWhile the Triwizard Tournament captivates the school's attention, a darker plot unfolds in Hogwarts' shadows.

The Shadow Brigade knows dark times are coming, but they've proven first-years can make a difference.\n\nSeeds for potential sequel:\n- Remaining ward weaknesses\n- Marina's allies still at large\n- Shadow realm connections\n- Death Eaters know about the Brigade\n- Umbridge year will be even darker"

But somewhere deep in the night, as clouds thicken over the castle and the last embers in the common room fire flicker low, she wakes with a dull ache and the undeniable, urgent need for the bathroom.\n\nThreading her feet into slippers and reaching for her wand out of habit\u2014\u201cjust in case,\u201d she murmurs, remembering the ever-practical advice of her mother\u2014Kathy shuffles into the softly-lit corridor branching from the common room. The belly of Hogwarts is mostly silent, faintly echoing with distant snores and the occasional creak of ancient plumbing.\n\nThe torchlight here seems steady at first, but as Kathy rounds a corner closer to the broad corridor that leads up toward the Hospital Wing, the air grows noticeably colder. A strange, swirling patch of darkness flickers at the far end, refusing to yield to even the healthy flames of the torches on the wall. The cold sharpens, seeping through the soles of her slippers and prickling at her arms. At the edge of hearing, something\u2014a whisper?\u2014slides through the silence in a language that makes the little hairs on the back of her neck stand up.  \n\nThe black shape ripples, darker than even the pooling shadows cast by the stone archway. It seems almost... aware.\n\nKathy stands frozen for a heartbeat, clutching her wand, heart hammering in her chest as the patch of wrongness slides just a fraction closer. This is not a trick of the light, nor a figment of tired eyes\u2014something truly unnatural has found its way into the corridors tonight.\n\nA choice waits in the chill silence: face the darkness with magic, try to backtrack to safety, or stand utterly still and hope to go unnoticed. The shadows are watching.</narration>"
