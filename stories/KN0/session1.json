Diagon Alley stretches before them, a riot of crooked shops and impossible architecture that defies every law of physics her father's books never quite prepared her for. Witches and wizards bustle past in robes of every color, some levitating parcels, others deep in animated conversation with moving portraits tucked under their arms.\n\n\"Remember,\" her mother murmurs, placing a gentle hand on Kathy's shoulder, \"this is your world now. You belong here just as much as anyone.\" There's pride in her voice, but also something else\u2014a tension that's been growing ever since the attack at the World Cup. Even now, her mother's eyes scan the crowd with the practiced wariness of someone who works in the Ministry's current climate of nervous denial.\n\nKathy clutches her Hogwarts letter, the parchment slightly crumpled from a summer of constant re-reading, and steps through the archway. The magical energy of the place seems to hum against her skin, making her fingertips tingle with anticipation.\n\n\"Where shall we start?\" her mother asks, though her gaze has already found the gleaming white marble of Gringotts Bank towering over the alley. \"Vault first, or would you prefer to see Ollivanders? Your wand is rather the most important purchase, after all.\"\n</narration>"

The wand chooses the witch, after all.\"\n\nThey weave through the crowd, past the colorful chaos of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes\u2014still under construction but already drawing curious onlookers\u2014and the gleaming window displays of Quality Quidditch Supplies. Kathy's head swivels constantly, trying to take in everything at once: a wizard juggling what appear to be small, glowing moons; a witch whose hat is home to a family of tiny, chirping birds; children about her age peering longingly through shop windows with the same expression she imagines she's wearing.\n\nThe narrow, shabby shop of Ollivanders appears between a cauldron shop and a store selling what looks like crystallized dragon scales. Its dusty window contains a single wand on a faded purple cushion, and the painted sign above has weathered to near-illegibility. Yet something about the place makes Kathy's skin prickle with anticipation.\n\n\"Ah,\" comes a soft voice as they enter, though the shop appears empty. Thousands of narrow boxes stretch up to the ceiling in the dim interior. \"I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Miss Nightingale.\"\n\nAn elderly man with wide, pale eyes emerges from the shadows between the shelves, moving with surprising grace for his apparent age.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Ollivander,\" her mother says with polite respect.\n\n\"Indeed it is.

Gentle. Precise. And yet...\" He tilts his head, studying her face. \"There's something else. A hunger for knowledge, perhaps?

The silvery motes drift around the three of them in lazy spirals before settling on the dusty surfaces of the shop, and wherever they touch, small imperfections seem to mend themselves: a chip in Mr. Ollivander's counter smooths over, a torn corner of parchment knits back together, even a wilted flower in a forgotten vase perks up with renewed life.\n\n\"Oh,\" Kathy breathes, and the sound comes out more like a sigh of relief than surprise. The wand doesn't feel foreign in her hand\u2014it feels like an extension of herself, as natural as her own heartbeat.\n\nMr. Ollivander claps his hands together once, a sharp sound that makes the remaining silver motes wink out. \"Excellent! Yes, very good indeed. Apple wood is particularly fond of those with high moral character, you know. And phoenix feather...\" His pale eyes gleam. \"A most rare and powerful core. This particular feather came from Fawkes himself\u2014Professor Dumbledore's phoenix.\"\n\nHer mother's hand tightens slightly on Kathy's shoulder, and when Kathy glances up, she sees something that might be pride mixed with worry in her expression.\n\n\"How much?\" her mother asks quietly.\n\n\"Seven galleons,\" Ollivander replies, already wrapping the wand in soft cloth. \"Though I suspect this particular wand will prove worth far more than that before long.\"\n</narration>"

But when you call for 'school money' in there...\" She gestures helplessly at the chaotic vault interior.\n\n\"Everything with even a trace of gold or silver tries to come at once,\" the other mother finishes. \"Last time we attempted it, we were buried under an avalanche of coins, jewelry, candlesticks, a tea set, several picture frames, and what we're fairly certain was great-grandfather's decorative sword collection.\"\n\nThe goblin nods gravely. \"Standard Gringotts policy discourages magical organization attempts in heavily cluttered vaults. Too many incidents of clients being injured by flying objects responding to overly broad Summoning Charms.\"\n\nMarcus looks fascinated despite himself. \"What about more specific spells? Like calling for exactly five galleons?\"\n\n\"That works better,\" Lyra admits, \"but you still risk getting five random galleons from different centuries, some of which might be cursed, commemorative, or part of a matched set that great-great-aunt Millicent specifically wanted kept together.\"\n\nEmmett stares at the teetering piles visible just inside the vault entrance. \"So you basically have to go treasure hunting in your own vault?\"\n\n\"Pretty much,\" Lyra sighs. \"Though to be fair, we have occasionally found things we'd forgotten we owned.

What's still on everyone's lists?\"\n\nKathy pulls out her Hogwarts letter, the parchment now somewhat crumpled from the day's adventures. \"Robes, telescope, quills, parchment, ink... and an owl, toad, or cat.\" She looks up hopefully. \"Can we look at the animals?\"\n\nEmmett brightens immediately. \"Oh yes, I'd love to see the magical creatures.

His father keeps asking questions like \"What do they eat?\" and \"Are they house-trained?\" while his mother worries about what the neighbors will think.\n\nMarcus looks hopeful but uncertain. \"How much do owls typically cost?\"\n\n\"Depends on the breed and age,\" Lyra says knowledgeably. \"Though Eeylops usually has a range of prices.
